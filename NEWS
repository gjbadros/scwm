Changes to scwm-0.4

set-xor-value! has been renamed to set-rubber-band-mask!.

Window-shades can now optionally be animated. (See gjb.scwmrc for an
example.)

Images are now Scheme objects. Anything that takes an image filename
string can now take either a filename string or an image
object. make-image creates an image object. set-icon-path! and
set-pixmap-path! are now gone and replaced by set-image-path!.

Paths are no longer environment-variable expanded; use the Scheme
procedure getenv if you need this.

wait-for-window now takes a predicate rather than a wildcard
string. You can pass (wildcard-matcher NAME) to get the old effect.

Implementation of decors and faces to allow a fair amount of
customization of the look. The low-level interface consists of the
make-decor, set-current-decor!, set-window-decor!, make-face,
set-title-face!, set-button-face!, set-button-mwm-flag! and
set-border-face! procedures, but the new (app scwm decor) and (app
scwm face) modules provide the friendlier wrappers with-decor,
title-style, button-style and border-style.

Added support for set-smart-placement-is-really-smart!,
set-click-to-focus-passes-click!, set-click-to-focus-raises! and
set-mouse-focus-click-raises!. These are obscure, but being able to
have click-to-focus without raising the window is nice.

New (app scwm fvwm-compat) module with some fvwm-compatability
procedures that are otherwise not very useful.

Added send-button-press and send-key-press to send synthetic mouse
button and keypress events.

Added animated moves - move-to can optionally animate the movement of
a window. See gjb.scwmrc for examples.

Added unbind-key and unbind-mouse - bindings can now be removed.

Added a sendscwm program and scwm-buffer.el; allows some interaction
with a running scwm, but the interface is not yet two-way.

Added sample.scwmrc/gjb.scwmrc, a scwmrc example that has more
features and shows off a lot of new functionality.

Improvements to the build process to make VPATH and dependencies work
correctly.

Many bug fixes.


Changes to scwm-0.3

Fixed prev-window and next-window to deal with windows that do not
accept the window focus. 

Fixed the wildcard matching mechanism.

Removed much unused C code. 

Many bug fixes to the distribution and configuration script; libm and
libdl are checked for, libguile is checked for more accurately, and
the srcdir/VPATH mechanism works.

Assorted fixes to the C files, including a fix of the longstanding bug
in interactive move that made moves start in the wrong place.

Changes to scwm-0.2

Autoconf configurability. No more futzing with imake, now you can just
./configure; make; make install.

Command line option support including interactive mode (scwm -i) which
reads your .scwrc and then gives you a read-eval-print loop with the
window manager. A recent snapshot of guile is needed for this to work
(but that should no longer be necessary in the next scwm release).

Fvwm2 Style command implemented (in a way that lets you change
[almost] any style option dynamically per window). User extensions to
the style command are also possible. Several non-fvwm style options
(e.g. start-maximize, start-window-shaded) are already available. See
the (app scwm style) module.

Improvements to the system.scwmrc file enabled by the implementation
of styles, and from user suggestions.

Changes to scwm-0.1

All fvwm2 functionality except styles, decors and modules is
implemented. 

Many bugs/limitations from the last release were fixed.

Scheme modules that provide extra useful operations are now available.

Initial release: scwm-0.0.0

Nearly all fvwm functionality is available, but a number of useful
things are missing.
