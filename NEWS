Changes to scwm-0.3

Fixed prev-window and next-window to deal with windows that do not
accept the window focus. 

Fixed the wildcard matching mechanism.

Removed much unused C code. 

Many bug fixes to the distribution and configuration script; libm and
libdl are checked for, libguile is checked for more accurately, and
the srcdir/VPATH mechanism works.

Assorted fixes to the C files, including a fix of the longstanding bug
in interactive move that made moves start in the wrong place.

Changes to scwm-0.2

Autoconf configurability. No more futzing with imake, now you can just
./configure; make; make install.

Command line option support including interactive mode (scwm -i) which
reads your .scwrc and then gives you a read-eval-print loop with the
window manager. A recent snapshot of guile is needed for this to work
(but that should no longer be necessary in the next scwm release).

Fvwm2 Style command implemented (in a way that lets you change
[almost] any style option dynamically per window). User extensions to
the style command are also possible. Several non-fvwm style options
(e.g. start-maximize, start-window-shaded) are already available. See
the (app scwm style) module.

Improvements to the system.scwmrc file enabled by the implementation
of styles, and from user suggestions.

Changes to scwm-0.1

All fvwm2 functionality except styles, decors and modules is
implemented. 

Many bugs/limitations from the last release were fixed.

Scheme modules that provide extra useful operations are now available.

Initial release: scwm-0.0.0

Nearly all fvwm functionality is available, but a number of useful
things are missing.
