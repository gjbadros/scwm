	* Improve scwm-buffer.el a bit more-- add C-M-z to send the s-exp
	after a delay, so the pointer can be moved before the wm evals the
	text.  Also don't explode the string into a list of characters,
	and update the patch to accept a string as the last argument to
	XChangeProperty.

	* gjb.scwmrc: updated to let C-S-F7, C-S-F8 use the window that
	the pointer is in;  this is less wierd than before, where
	unfocussed windows could not be moved easily w/ the keyboard
