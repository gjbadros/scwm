	* utilities/dev/fvwm2-module-adapter: Pretty much works now - runs
 	the fvwm2 pager flawlessly if you load it into a running scwm,
 	other modules may or may not work (for testing change the module
 	name at the end). However, this functionality really needs to be
 	packaged better, and some stuff on the C side needs cleaning up.

Fri Feb 27 21:16:29 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

 	of installation directories -- thanks to Simon Josefsson
 	<jas@pdc.kth.se>

	* sample.scwmrc/{gjb.scwmrc,menu-test.scm}: Updated to use much
	more dynamic features -- using 'foo as a procedure or a color or a 
	menu or a font means delay getting the object that that symbol
	contains until it is really needed so that it the actual object
	can be defined or redefined later without recreating all the
	objects.

	and update the patch to accept a string as the last argument to
	XChangeProperty.
