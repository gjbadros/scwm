	* Makefile.in, utilities/dev/Makefile.in,
 	utilities/scwmexec/Makefile.in, utilities/Makefile.in: regenerated
 	with automake 1.3 (others too, see individual ChangeLogs)

	aclocal.m4: regenrated with aclocal 1.3

	HACKING: updated to suggest automake 1.3

Thu Apr  2 16:24:30 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Scwm has been converted to work with Automake and Libtool, the
 	following changes were involved:

	configure.in: set up Automake and Libtool

	acconfig.h: accomodate some Automake-specific changes
	
	configure, include/config.h.in: regenerated autoconf

	Makefile.am, app/Makefile.am, sample.scwmrc/Makefile.am,
 	scheme/Makefile,am, scwm/Makefile.am, utilities/Makefile.am,
 	utilities/dev/Makefile.am, utilities/emacs/Makefile.am,
 	utilities/libscwmexec/Makefile.am, utilities/scwmexec/Makefile.am,
 	utilities/scwmrepl/Makefile.am: new Makefile.am files for use with
 	automake; based roughly on old Makefile.in's

	Makefile.in, app/Makefile.in, sample.scwmrc/Makefile.in,
 	scheme/Makefile,in, scwm/Makefile.in, utilities/Makefile.in,
 	utilities/dev/Makefile.in, utilities/emacs/Makefile.in,
 	utilities/libscwmexec/Makefile.in, utilities/scwmexec/Makefile.in,
 	utilities/scwmrepl/Makefile.in: Generated from corresponding
 	Makefile.am's using automake

	acconfig.m4: generated by aclocal

	config.guess, config.sub, install-sh, libtool, ltconfog,
 	ltmain.sh, missing, mkinstalldirs, utilities/emacs/elisp-comp:
	Added by automake --add-missing or libtoolize.

	AUTHORS, COPYING, THANKS, stamp-h.in: added to make automake stop
 	complaining, or because it seemed appropriate in light of other
 	files (since there was an AUTHORS I felt there should be a
 	THANKS).

	HACKING: explains where to get the tools now needed to hack scwm,
 	and how to use them.

	version.h: removed.

	Some benefits from use of automake and libtool: bulletproof
 	dependency generation; `make uninstall' works; scwm.el is
 	installed in the proper site-lisp directory; all builddir !=
 	srcdir problems should go away; inter-directory dependencies work
 	OK; a shared library of libscwmexec is built and installed; less
 	work is needed to get the relevant install paths compiled
 	in. Soon, it should enable a reasonable setup for buiklding shared
 	library modules in a cross-platform manner.

	* utilities/scwmrepl/scwmrepl.c, utilities/scwmexec/scwmexec.c:

1998-03-19 Thu 16:08:43 EST Sam Steingold <sds@usa.net>

	* utilities/emacs/scwm.el: fixed completion, documentation and
	scwm-run.  The latter re-runs scwmrepl in the same buffer now.

Thu Mar 12 20:28:57 1998  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* utilities/*/Makefile.in: Move -lscwmexec to directly after
 	-L../libscwmexec, instead of after the X libraries -- was causing
 	problems with `cc' on Irix 6.2 for Jesse Glick.

Thu Mar 12 09:20:49 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* utilities/emacs/scwm.el: Added scwm-procedure-documentation, and
 	some support functions; Fixed scwm-complete to go back an sexp,
 	not just a word

Wed Mar 11 22:56:28 1998  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* utilities/emacs/scwm.el: Added rudimentary completion support --
	mostly proof of concept that an elisp guru should look at.

Wed Mar 11 21:57:57 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

 	report.

Mon Mar  9 09:12:21 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* utilities/scwmexec/scwmexec.c: Use scwmexec_exec_full and

Sat Feb 28 19:24:18 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* utilities/dev/fvwm2-module-adapter: Pretty much works now - runs
 	the fvwm2 pager flawlessly if you load it into a running scwm,
 	other modules may or may not work (for testing change the module
 	name at the end). However, this functionality really needs to be
 	packaged better, and some stuff on the C side needs cleaning up.

Fri Feb 27 21:16:29 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* configure.in configure utilities/Makefile.in: Build system
 	changes to make scwmrepl.

	* utilities/scwmrepl/scwmrepl.c, utilities/scwmrepl/Makefile.in:
	A new program using libscwmexec; it gives you a repl session
	with a running scwm.

	* configure.in configure utilities/Makefile.in: Build system
 	changes to make scwmsend and libscwmsend.

	* utilities/libscwmexec/libmain.c,
 	utlities/libscwmexec/scwmsend.h, utlities/libscwmexec/Makefile.in,
 	utilities/scwmexec/scwmexec.c, utilities/scwmexec/Makefile.in:
	library and example program for the new scwmexec protocol.


Thu Feb 26 21:46:06 1998  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* utilities/emacs/scwm-buffer.el: Updated to use the $DISPLAY
 	environment variable to choose which X server to open a connection

Wed Feb 25 21:10:28 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

 	of installation directories -- thanks to Simon Josefsson
 	<jas@pdc.kth.se>

	* sample.scwmrc/{gjb.scwmrc,menu-test.scm}: Updated to use much
	more dynamic features -- using 'foo as a procedure or a color or a
	menu or a font means delay getting the object that that symbol
	contains until it is really needed so that it the actual object
	can be defined or redefined later without recreating all the
	objects.

Thu Dec  4 18:45:48 1997  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Improve scwm-buffer.el a bit more-- add C-M-z to send the s-exp
	after a delay, so the pointer can be moved before the wm evals the
	text.  Also don't explode the string into a list of characters,
	and update the patch to accept a string as the last argument to
	XChangeProperty.

	* gjb.scwmrc: updated to let C-S-F7, C-S-F8 use the window that
	the pointer is in;  this is less wierd than before, where
	unfocussed windows could not be moved easily w/ the keyboard

Wed Nov 12 16:11:21 1997  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Improvements to scwm-buffer.el, to use Emacs interface to Xlib

 	used for argument parsing. Patch from James LewisMoss
 	<dres@dimensional.com>. Regenerated configure and config.h.in.

	* configure.in, configure: Don't try too create a Makefile in libs
 	any more during the configure process. configure regenerated from
 	configure.in.

	* Fix some build problems

Sun Oct 19 01:30:37 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Conditionally set CFLAGS from configure.

	* configure: Regenerated from configure.in.

	* configure.in: Added -g to the list of default build
 	flags. Suggested by Mikael Djurfeldt <mdj@nada.kth.se> to comply
 	with GNU coding standards.

	* configure.in: Added more accurate checks to make sure that
 	libguile is 1.2 or higher; also check if the libguile is recent
 	enough to support the interactive repl. Also create a makefile in
 	the app subdirectory (the only purpose of which is to create a
 	symlink scwm => ../scheme there to ensure that running in pllace
 	works.
