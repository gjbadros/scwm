	* Makefile.in: Conditionally set CFLAGS from configure.

	* version.h: Bumped version to 0.3

	* configure: Regenerated from configure.in.

	* configure.in: Added -g to the list of default build
 	flags. Suggested by Mikael Djurfeldt <mdj@nada.kth.se> to comply
 	with GNU coding standards.

	* configure.in: Added more accurate checks to make sure that
 	libguile is 1.2 or higher; also check if the libguile is recent
 	enough to support the interactive repl. Also create a makefile in
 	the app subdirectory (the only purpose of which is to create a
 	symlink scwm => ../scheme there to ensure that running in pllace
 	works.
