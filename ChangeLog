	* autogen.sh: Added "-I ." when running aclocal -- suggested by

	using a subshell in the guile sources).

Tue Sep  7 23:47:16 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.in: Use cassowary-config script if it is installed to
	determine the GTL libs --- assume no GTL if no script exists.

	* RH6-notes: Added -- notes for installing scwm on top of RH6

	* configure.in (scwm_pixmapdir): Change scwm_pixmapdir so it'll be 
	e.g. /usr/pixmaps/scwm instead of /usr/scwm/pixmaps (scwm-icons
	gets installed in /usr/pixmaps/scwm).  Use @prefix@ instead of
	/usr in other scwm_image_load_path positions.

	* scwm.spec.in: Give --with-cassowary option to make it use the
	constraint solver.

Fri Aug 27 00:19:19 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.spec.in: Do not use exec_prefix including X11R6-- just let
	binaries go in /usr/bin.  Fix %post, %postun sections to use files 
	from installed locations, not source locations.  Run ldconfig to
	update for libraries (e.g., libscwmexec.so).  Updates to %files section.

Thu Aug 26 22:55:17 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

Thu Aug 26 12:15:35 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* README: Constraints, not configurable.  Added PACKAGE TESTING

	maintenance.  Update URL.

	* configure.in: Added utilities/misc/Makefile to files to
	generate.

	* autogen.sh: Run configure, not config.status, at conclusion;
 	added some smarts about grabbing the last configure line that
 	works for me but might not in the general case.

	* Makefile.am: Put include/arg_unused.h in EXTRA_DIST

	* HACKING: Added note about doc/dev/scwm-packaging-rpm.txt

1999-08-13  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* autogen.sh: Remove ltcondif and ltmain.sh since these things are 
	generated by the local libtool, but only if they do not already
	exist.  This has caused problems more than once for people.
	Perhaps we should just not distribute the files from CVS?

Sat Jul 31 19:28:58 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* include/arg_unused.h: Macros ARG_IGNORE and ARG_UNUSED that were 
	defined in scwm.h before, but were needed in other programs, too.

Sat Jul 31 19:28:43 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* include/arg_unused.h: Added

Mon Jul 26 14:39:59 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	alphabetized Maciej and me, as ok'd by him.

	* configure.in (DL_SUPPORT): Check for dlopen in libc, too, not
	just in libdl.  For NetBSD-- thanks Perry Metzger!

Thu Jul 22 08:12:17 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.in (DL_SUPPORT): Make DL_SUPPORT an AM_CONDITIONAL.

Sun Jul 18 17:33:34 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Update to scwm.mit.edu;  New notes in BUG-REPORTING

Sat Jul 17 21:21:02 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.in: Set version number to post0.99.1;  though we never 
	released a version 0.99.1, Francessco had a Debian version from
	CVS with that number, so skipping 0.99.1 will avoid confusion.
	Our next release should be 0.99.2, and then we bump to post0.99.2
	in CVS right away.

Fri Jul 16 17:52:56 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.spec.in: Drop /usr/share/scwm-{modules,themes}-- no longer
	needed.  Thanks Jay Belanger.

Fri Jul 16 17:52:13 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.in: Make HAVE_XTEST an automake condition, and create
	modules/xtest/Makefile

Tue Jul 13 23:04:20 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.in:  export CFLAGS so --enable-cflags=XXX works.
	Added --enable-cppflags, --enable-cxxflags.  Set PREFIX_INCLUDES
	to the prefix/include directory.  Check for GTL library for
	constraint solver (link against it only if found).  Set
	DL_SUPPORT=true iff dlopen is found (not used elsewhere, yet).

Fri Jul  9 15:05:04 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* INSTALL: Updated with notes about dynamically-linked files,
	guile-gtk, the guile-1.3 patch.

Tue Jul  6 12:41:38 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* guile-1.3-includes.patch: Added -- reference this in
	BUILD-PROBLEMS-FAQ;  these are my local patches to the guile
	headers to get Scwm to compile w/o warnings.

Tue Jul  6 08:28:15 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.in: Fixed bug -- XEXT_LIB was getting reset to "" when 
	testing for the XTST_LIB.  Thanks for bug report Harald Meland.

Mon Jul  5 19:27:03 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.in: Point scwm_image_load_path at ${scwm_pixmapdir}
	(it changed values, and it's old one was duplicated here,
	stupidly).

Sun Jul  4 21:40:19 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.in: Check for libXtst, set HAVE_XTEST, and substitute
	XTST_LIB for scwm_LDADD line in scwm/Makefile.am

	* acconfig.h: Added HAVE_XTEST line.

Sun Jul  4 21:37:50 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* include/config.h.in: Removed this from CVS -- it's generated by
	autoheader (run by autogen.sh)-- be sure snapshot script makes the 
	file.

Sat Jul  3 00:24:25 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* HACKING: Some updates and clarifications.

Fri Jul  2 09:54:59 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.in: Change install directories from scwm-foo, to
	scwm/foo for /modules, /themes, /pixmaps, and /util.

Thu Jul  1 22:02:48 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.in: Try to make --enable-c-flags option work by
	setting CFLAGS before AC_PROG_CC macro call.  (Untested)

Thu Jul  1 22:00:36 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* acconfig.h: Fix typo in comment; updated email addresses.

Thu Jul  1 10:08:15 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.in: Let SCWM_ARG_PATH take a withval that is not a
	pre-existing directory-- if so, create the directory and print a
	warning, but use the value.  Thanks Francesco Tapparo!

Thu Jul  1 09:36:23 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.in: Added scwm_pixmapdir, and have pixmaps go in
	$libdir/scwm-pixmaps now.  Make sure that directory is in
	scwm_image_load_path by putting it first.  Do the AC_SUBST on
	scwm_pixmapdir so pixmaps/Makefile.am works.

Thu Jul  1 09:03:53 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* pixmaps/Makefile.in: removed

	* pixmaps/Makefile.am: added (replacing Makefile.in, so make dist
	will work for this directory).  Now pixmaps get installed in
	$(libdir)/scwm-pixmaps;  e.g., /usr/lib/scwm-pixmaps/.

Wed Jun 30 09:38:12 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Updated all refs to vicarious-existence.mit.edu to serveuse.mit.edu

Tue Jun 29 15:55:12 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* include/config.h.in: Added HAVE_SETENV to list of cpp macros to
	set.

	* configure.in: Check for setenv function -- HP/UX and AIX do not
	have it (thanks Stephen Tell!)

Sat May  1 19:10:17 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* pixmaps/Makefile.in: Added

	* Makefile.am: Added pixmaps/ subdirectory so those files will get 
	installed.

	* configure.in: Create pixmaps/Makefile.  Added -lGTL to
	CASSOWARY_LIBS line (if you're not using cassowary from CVS,
	you'll need to remove this... sorry).

Tue Apr 27 20:59:57 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* THANKS: Added Michael Livshin -- contributed
	  maximize-and-move.scm (holding off on putting in the repository
	  to consider his suggestion to use hooks, instead).

Thu Apr 22 20:13:20 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.in: Added utilities/run-renamed/Makefil as a file to generate.

Thu Apr 22 16:32:23 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.in (scwm_image_load_path): Added scwm_utildir -- not
	used now, except by the broken utilities/pidproperty/Makefile.am.broken.

Tue Apr 20 21:17:47 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.in: Added utilities/pidproperty/Makefile as a file to generate.

Thu Apr 15 20:04:41 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* libtool-deps.patch: Added -- I need this patch to my generated
	libtool to work around the inter-library dependence bug (see
	libtool web page for more information).  Our snapshot script
	should run this to patch libtool before packaging up.

Thu Apr 15 19:54:07 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* acconfig.h: Added USE_PROPLIST #define -- not used right now
	(and hopefully can stay that way).

	* configure.in: Added --with-proplist=DIR option for building
	proplist module.

Wed Apr 14 10:18:33 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* README: Fix Maciej's email address.

	* INSTALL: Note that we test against guile-1.3, not 1.2.

Tue Apr 13 16:03:15 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.in: Append /lib, /include to the --with-cassowary
	directory argument.  Thanks Toby Sargeant!

1999-04-07  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* esd.m4, imlib.m4: Removed - these are now in acinclude.m4.

Wed Apr  7 11:36:53 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Updated all copyrights for files changed in 1999.  Added word
	"Copyright" where it was missing.  Added some people to copyright
	lists where they were missing.  Other header comment updates
	including fixing Dollar-Id-Dollar (missing last dollar on
	occasion), filename references, and more.

1999-04-03  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* .cvsignore: Ignore ltconfig, ltmain.sh (generated by
	libtoolize).

	* autogen.sh: Move autoheader before automake to fix one warning.

Tue Mar 30 18:44:03 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.in: Test for imlib, added --disable-imlib option to
	turn it off even when found.  Update --enable-warnings to use
	-Wno-sign-compare which turns off warnings about signedness.  Add
	a note about it using gcc-specific flags.

	* imlib.m4: Added, but also appended to acinclude.m4 since that's
	where it gets looked for by default.

	* acinclude.m4: Appended esd.m4 and imlib.m4 to this file.
	Perhaps we should split them (and gtk.m4) back out and include
	them somehow instead.  I don't have time to debug that now, though.

Mon Mar 29 15:24:57 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.imlib.in: Drop some redundancy, propagate some
	configure.in changes.  We need to make imlib support a normal
	option soon, but I don't know how this works for gtk.

1999-03-28  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* configure.in: Added modules/esdsound/Makefile to outputs.
	Also check for libesd and define HAVE_ESD accordingly.
	* esd.m4: New file, used by configure.in.

Sun Mar 28 16:21:27 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.lsm: Fix Maciej's email to @alum.mit.edu

Fri Mar 26 09:01:12 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.in (scwm_image_load_path): Set this string using a for
 	loop, and only add directories if they exist.  Also add
 	/usr/share/{pixmaps,icons,mini} to the list of directories to use
 	if they exist (Sam Steingold points out that these are standard
 	RedHat locations).

1999-03-25  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* configure.in: Added --enable-cflags.

Thu Mar 25 18:36:44 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.in: Bump version to 0.99.1 since it should not be
	0.9.1-snap any longer.

1999-03-23  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* autogen.sh: Add --copy to libtoolize call, as we don't want to
	distribute symlinks.

Tue Mar 23 11:46:00 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* THANKS: Added imlib support to James LewisMoss's contribution list.

	* acconfig.h: Added #undef USE_IMLIB for that option.

	* configure.imlib.in: Added temporarily, until someone else works
	out how to integrate the IMLIB checks into the configure.in for
	systems w/o imlib installed.  Can copy configure.imlib.in to
	configure.in, sh autogen.sh, and the configure if you have imlib
	installed.

Tue Mar 23 11:43:34 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.in: Drop checking for scm_make_vector behaviour -- no
	longer used.

Thu Mar 18 09:51:47 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* THANKS: Added entries at top for Carl Witty for his
 	documentation fixes and code cleanup, Jeffrey Nichols for the
 	message window feature, UI for constraints.

Wed Mar 17 18:41:12 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.in: Added SCWM_ARG_PATH_MAYBE_EMPTY macro to support
	"--with-cassowary" w/o a "=DIR" argument to use the $PREFIX dir.
	Simplify CASSOWARY_LIBS to work with new, installable distribution 
	of Cassowary (>= 0.4).

Wed Mar 17 11:17:38 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* acinclude.m4: Do not call AC_PATH_PROG macro for gtk-config if
	its path has already been decided (through use, e.g., of the
	--with-gtk-prefix option).  This lets me choose between gtk-1.2.0,
	and gtk-1.0.6 at configure time.

Wed Mar 17 10:37:20 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.in: Fix spelling mistake, added --enable-warnings option.

1999-02-12  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.in: Added -lstdc++ to list for link line for
	--with-cassowary since it seems to be getting linked with gcc
	instead of g++ sometimes.

1999-02-08  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@alum.mit.edu>

	* HACKING: Bumped reccomended tool versions to Autoconf 2.13,
	Automake 1.4 and Libtool 1.2d. Updated download pointers.

Fri Feb  5 20:36:30 1999  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@alum.mit.edu>

        * configure.in: Bump version number to something appropriate for
        CVS.

Wed Jan 27 08:15:20 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* **/*: Updated all refs to huis-clos.mit.edu to
	vicarious-existence.mit.edu

Sat Jan 23 10:51:20 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* pixmaps/cn-keep-above.xpm, pixmaps/cn-keep-to-left-of.xpm:
	Added;  edited to have dashed dividing line showing forced border, 
	and make keep-above have a more vertical arrow connecting the two windows

Wed Jan 20 10:48:32 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.spec: Added. Thanks Harvey Stein!

Wed Jan 20 10:31:40 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.in (scwm_image_load_path): Added
	modules/xlib-drawing/Makefile to AC_OUTPUT list

	* THANKS: Added Kjetil Wiekhorst Jørgensen -- he did orig. version
	of RPM Updated Harvey's note to thank for RPMs.

Mon Jan 11 18:19:58 1999  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstx@VICARIOUS-EXISTENCE.MIT.EDU>

	* NEWS: Updated for 0.9 (only rough outline of changes - still
 	needs editing).

x1999-01-07  Todd Larason  <jtl@molehill.org>

	* autogen.sh: Add libtoolize call
	* ltmain.sh, ltconfig: remove

1999-01-05  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* gtk.m4: Renamed to acinclude.m4. On machines that had gtk.m4 in
	their aclocal dir, "aclocal -I ." failed because of a duplicated
	macro. This should work for all.
	* autogen.sh: Removed -I . option again - not needed because of
	the above change.

Sun Dec 27 16:08:52 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Don't require gtk+-1.0.6 or higher for gtk stuff
 	to work; 1.0.0 should be sufficient.

Sun Dec  6 02:57:38 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* configure.in, acconfig.h: Check for scm_make_hook so we know if
 	new-style hooks are in effect.

	* BUGS: Document limitations of kept-on-top windows.

Sat Dec  5 18:45:26 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* HACKING: Add required perl, makeinfo, Parse-RecDescent package
 	versions for documentation hacking; split into named sections.

1998-11-22  Todd Larason  <jtl@molehill.org>

	* THANKS: remove myself from the thanks list, add Russell Nelson

Fri Nov 20 01:57:57 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* autogen.sh: Add -I . option to aclocal to catch m4 macros in
 	scwm dir.

	* configure.in: Check for Gtk+; create
 	modules/scwmgtkhelper/Makefile.

	* gtk.m4: Added so people using scwm from CVS who don't have Gtk+
 	will not lose.

Tue Nov 17 01:56:17 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Version 0.9beta1 released.

	* configure.in: Bumped version to 0.9beta1

	* ANNOUNCE, NEWS: Updated for 0.9beta1

	* app/Makefile.am: Add scwm to DISTCLEANFILES to comply with GNU
 	Makefile standards. Patch from Francesco Tapparo.

	* README, ANNOUNCE, scwm.lsm: Updated for 0.9beta1. No new feature
 	hilight list in ANNOUNCE yet.

	* AUTHORS: Updated my entry.

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Mention more files that should be
 	distributed.

	* HACKING: Remove note about automake bug, since we decided to
 	work around it after all.

	* THANKS: Added new contributors since 0.8; corrected some details
 	on Rebecca Schulman's entry; removed Todd Larason since he has
 	been promoted to AUTHORS.

1998-11-16  Todd Larason  <jtlmolehill.org>

	* AUTHORS: added myself *blush*

Mon Nov 16 22:21:21 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Generate scwmdoc and scwmdoc.scm from the default
 	templates.

Sun Nov 15 15:54:56 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Applied patch from Stephen Tell <tell@cs.unc.edu>
 	to check $prefix for Guile libraries when $exec_prefix is not set,
 	and to check for SMlib.h.	

Mon Nov  9 10:42:47 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* configure.in (guile_lib_path): Check for GNU tar, define theme
 	directory, process themes/Makefile.in.

	* Makefile.am: Process themes directory.

Tue Oct 27 23:24:07 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Generate Makefile in modules/c-animation

Sat Oct 24 17:08:18 1998  Robert Bihlmeyer <e9426626@stud2.tuwien.ac.at>

	* configure.in: Spurious -L removed from $guile_lib_path.

	* acconfig.h: Cut&Paste error fixed.

Thu Oct 22 05:47:50 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Generate Makefile for modules/background dir.

1998-10-16  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* configure.in (scwm_image_load_path): modules/pie-menus/Makefile
	added

Sun Oct 11 15:18:01 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.in: Added modules/overlay-plane/Makefile

Wed Oct  7 19:16:36 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* HACKING: Added note about automake bug.

1998-10-06  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* configure.in: define and substitute scwm_bin_load_path and
	scwm_moduledir for binary modules, analagous to scwm_load_path and
	scwm_schemedir; substitute in modules/Makefile and
	modules/xpm-menus/Makefile
	(guile_lib_path): use AC_PATH_PROGS instead of AC_PATH_PROG to
	find guile-config or build-guile, and remove erroneous comma

	* Makefile.am: add 'modules' to SUBDIRS

Sun Oct  4 18:16:10 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Check for guile-config, the script formerly known
 	as build-guile, as well as build-guile; replace BUILD_GUILE with
 	GUILE_CONFIG throughout so this future anachronism doesn't confuse
 	people later.

Wed Sep 30 19:15:15 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Process perl and guile script templates in
 	utilities/dev to generate versions with the proper path to the
 	interpreter.

1998-09-27  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* BUGS (RESOLVED): moved nonstandard-border-width/se-gravity
	window positioning bug to RESOLVED

Wed Sep  9 16:11:30 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm-bug-report-information: Added, with use of ldd optional

Wed Sep  9 09:28:38 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.in: Do an AC_SUBST on SM_LIB since -lSM -lICE were not
	being added to the link line (see also changes to scwm/Makefile.am)

Sat Sep  5 13:22:14 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* doc/dev/: Added X*.ps.gz documentation for ICE and session
	management, from X11 R6.3 doc tree

Fri Sep  4 11:49:24 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.in: Move the AC_PROG_CXX macro back out of the
	with-cassowary branch so CXX always gets set.  Automake appears to
	output a $(CXXLINK) build rule when any source files are C++, so
	we need CXX set.   Users w/o a C++ compiler who want to use scwm
	w/o cassowary can build it using e.g.,
	  CXX=$CC CXXFLAGS=$CFLAGS ./configure
	or, more specifically
	  CXX=gcc CXXFLAGS="-Wall -O2" ./configure

	also separated out the session_manager_srcs so that the session
	manager support is only built if libSM and libICE are found

Thu Sep  3 14:15:23 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.in, acconfig.h: Check for libSM, libICE and set
	HAVE_LIBSM_LIBICE in config.h (for session-manager support)

Thu Sep  3 11:24:32 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.in: Only look for a C++ compiler if --with-cassowary
	is used

Thu Sep  3 10:59:46 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.in: Lots of changes mostly from Dirk Herrmann.  He
	writes:

	The patch does basically a reordering: First check for
 	--with-guile-prefix and --with-guile-exec-prefix and use the
 	resulting paths when searching for build-guile.

	I also changed the meaning of --with-guile-exec-prefix to really
	point to the guile binaries directory and added options
	--with-guile-include-prefix and --with-guile-lib-prefix.

	I tried to somehow keep the original structure, though: first test
	for  programs, later test for libraries. However, this looks a
	little bit unnatural for the guile tests, since the tests for
	--with-guile-prefix and --with-guile-exec-prefix are performed
	with the program checks, while --with-guile-include-prefix and
	--with-guile-lib-prefix are performed later with the library
	checks. Maybe the checks for the guile related command line
	options should be moved together, still keeping the checks for
	programs and libraries themselves separate.

	Also, he added the m4 macro abstraction SCWM_ARG_PATH, and cleaned
	up various uses of "test" as suggested for portability by the
	Solaris test man page

1998-08-31  Robert Bihlmeyer  <e9426626@stud2.tuwien.ac.at>

	* configure.in, scwm/Makefile.am: If --with-cassowary was given to
 	configure, build a cassowary scwm from the standard Makefile.

Fri Aug 28 17:03:57 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.in: S. Inverted sense of ac_R_nospace (from S.Senda --
 	fix to earlier change)

Thu Aug 20 13:53:19 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* acconfig.h, configure.in:  Test for X_LOCALE, add -R arguments
	for ld for Solaris (and other?) builds that want it (test
	ac_R_nospace)


Fri Aug 14 10:43:47 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.in, configure: Scwm-0.8 released!

Fri Aug 14 10:19:42 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* INSTALL: Added note about using ./configure --help for list of
	  configuration options

	* THANKS: Move Francesco Tapparo to top group of people since he
	  maintains the Debian scwm package in addition to providing bug
	  reports and patches

	* configure.in: Lots of bug fixes -- no more use of
	  ac_prev... what was that var?  Ensure directory parameters are
	  not just "yes" or "no" (i.e., omitted dir arg), and add
	  --with-scwmrcdir option (Thanks Francesco Tapparo)

Mon Aug  3 15:11:21 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* TODO: Updated to include 0.8 list, some other commentary.

Wed Jul 29 19:18:11 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	  use it for XmuPrintDefaultErrorMessage.

Sat Jul 18 16:30:09 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* configure.in: Added --with-cassowary flag for the constraint
	solver

1998-07-15  Robert Bihlmeyer  <e9426626@stud2.tuwien.ac.at>

	* configure: Use prefix/exec-prefix as defaults for
	guile-prefix/guile-exec-prefix.

1998-07-13  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny5-15.ix.netcom.com>

	* configure.in, acconfig.h: Check wether scm_make_vector needs a
	third argument (newer Guiles only take 2).

Fri Jul 10 10:44:26 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* configure.in, acconfig.h: Check for setlinebuf and setvbuf (patch
 	from Stephen Tell <tell@cs.unc.edu>); also use AC_CHECK_FUNCS in
 	favor of AC_CHECK_FUNC.

1998-07-09  Robert Bihlmeyer  <e9426626@stud2.tuwien.ac.at>

	Removed a lot of autogenerated files from CVS.
	* .cvsignore: Ignore them.

1998-07-04  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

 	* BUGS: Added callback bug note

Fri Jul  3 17:46:16 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>


	* INSTALL:  Added note about --with-guile-prefix

1998-06-27  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny5-05.ix.netcom.com>

	* configure.in, configure: Forgot to add "-lguile" to GUILE_LIBS
	in the non-build-guile fork of checking for guile libs.

1998-06-26  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny1-21.ix.netcom.com>

	* configure.in, configure: Bumped version to 0.7a (forgot to do
	this before).

	* configure.in, configure: Add --with-guile-prefix=DIR and
	--with-guile-exec-prefix=DIR to help people who have Guile
	installed in a funny place. Substitute the new GUILE_INCLUDES
	variable and use it where appropriate.

1998-06-22  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny2-11.ix.netcom.com>

	* configure.in, configure, acconfig.h, include/config.in.h: Detect
	scm_internal_parse_path, which should be used in lieu of
	scm_parse_path when it exists.

	* configure.in, configure: Version bumped to 0.7

1998-06-21  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny5-09.ix.netcom.com>

	* configure.in: Bumped version to 0.6c to indicate prerelease
	version.

1998-06-21  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny5-21.ix.netcom.com>

	* GOALS: Updated to reflect achieved goals.

	* configure.in, configure: Add --with-lispdir=DIR option, allowing
	the user to specify where Emacs-lisp files are to be installed.

1998-06-20  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny5-15.ix.netcom.com>

	* configure.in, configure, Makefile.am, Makefile.in: build the new
	scwm manual in the doc directory.

1998-06-18  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny5-14.ix.netcom.com>

	* configure.in, acconfig.h: Detect scm_internal_cwdr and

 	utilities/scwmexec/Makefile.in, utilities/Makefile.in: regenerated
 	with automake 1.3 (others too, see individual ChangeLogs)

	aclocal.m4: regenrated with aclocal 1.3

	HACKING: updated to suggest automake 1.3

Thu Apr  2 16:24:30 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Scwm has been converted to work with Automake and Libtool, the
 	following changes were involved:

	configure.in: set up Automake and Libtool

	acconfig.h: accomodate some Automake-specific changes

	configure, include/config.h.in: regenerated autoconf

	Makefile.am, app/Makefile.am, sample.scwmrc/Makefile.am,
 	scheme/Makefile,am, scwm/Makefile.am, utilities/Makefile.am,
 	utilities/dev/Makefile.am, utilities/emacs/Makefile.am,
 	utilities/libscwmexec/Makefile.am, utilities/scwmexec/Makefile.am,
 	utilities/scwmrepl/Makefile.am: new Makefile.am files for use with
 	automake; based roughly on old Makefile.in's

	Makefile.in, app/Makefile.in, sample.scwmrc/Makefile.in,
 	scheme/Makefile,in, scwm/Makefile.in, utilities/Makefile.in,
 	utilities/dev/Makefile.in, utilities/emacs/Makefile.in,
 	utilities/libscwmexec/Makefile.in, utilities/scwmexec/Makefile.in,
 	utilities/scwmrepl/Makefile.in: Generated from corresponding
 	Makefile.am's using automake

	acconfig.m4: generated by aclocal

	config.guess, config.sub, install-sh, libtool, ltconfog,
 	ltmain.sh, missing, mkinstalldirs, utilities/emacs/elisp-comp:
	Added by automake --add-missing or libtoolize.

	AUTHORS, COPYING, THANKS, stamp-h.in: added to make automake stop
 	complaining, or because it seemed appropriate in light of other
 	files (since there was an AUTHORS I felt there should be a
 	THANKS).

	HACKING: explains where to get the tools now needed to hack scwm,
 	and how to use them.

	version.h: removed.

	Some benefits from use of automake and libtool: bulletproof
 	dependency generation; `make uninstall' works; scwm.el is
 	installed in the proper site-lisp directory; all builddir !=
 	srcdir problems should go away; inter-directory dependencies work
 	OK; a shared library of libscwmexec is built and installed; less
 	work is needed to get the relevant install paths compiled
 	in. Soon, it should enable a reasonable setup for buiklding shared
 	library modules in a cross-platform manner.

Tue Mar 31 23:44:08 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* include/scwm/scwmlib.h: Removed this unused file.

	* sample.scwmrc/{gjb.scwmrc,menu-test.scm}: Updated to use much
	more dynamic features -- using 'foo as a procedure or a color or a

	can be defined or redefined later without recreating all the
	objects.

	* Improve scwm-buffer.el a bit more-- add C-M-z to send the s-exp
	after a delay, so the pointer can be moved before the wm evals the
	text.  Also don't explode the string into a list of characters,
	and update the patch to accept a string as the last argument to
	XChangeProperty.

	* gjb.scwmrc: updated to let C-S-F7, C-S-F8 use the window that
	the pointer is in;  this is less wierd than before, where
	unfocussed windows could not be moved easily w/ the keyboard
