Scwm 0.9 is released.

* What Scwm is:

Scwm is the Scheme Configurable Window Manager. This is a highly
dynamic and extensible window manager and scripting facility for the X
Window System (based originally on fvwm2, but now much enhanced) with
Guile Scheme as the configuration/extension language. Nearly all
decorations can be changed at run-time or per-window, and eventually
many decoration styles and additional features will be supported
through dynamically loaded code. A powerful protocol is provided for
interacting with the window manager while it is running.

* Where you can get it:

You can download the latest scwm source package from:

ftp://scwm.mit.edu/pub/scwm/scwm-0.9beta.tar.gz

There is also
ftp://scwm.mit.edu/pub/scwm/scwm-icons-0.8.tar.gz

which has a number of images for use with scwm as icons, textures,
buttons, etc. Some of these images are not available otherwise.

You will also need to download and install the guile library. You can
get the latest release from:

ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/guile-1.3.tar.gz

or any archive that has GNU source packages available.

You can get the latest guile snapshot from:

ftp://red-bean.com/pub/guile

The snapshots are officially alpha but they generally work pretty
well; however, 1.3 is reccomended for now since it is pretty
recent. Guile 1.2 will also work but support will be removed in a
coming release.


* Binary packages

ftp://scwm.mit.edu/pub/scwm/scwm-0.9-1.i386.rpm

The source RPM is at 

ftp://scwm.mit.edu/pub/scwm/scwm-0.9-1.src.rpm

This package requires the guile-1.3 package from Red Hat RawHide.

Other binary packages of this release may become available over time.
