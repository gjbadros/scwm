Scwm 0.99.2 is released.

* What Scwm is:

Scwm is the Scheme Constraints Window Manager, a highly dynamic and
extensible window manager for the X Window System.  Scwm embeds Guile
Scheme as the configuration and extension language, and includes a
sophisticated constraint solver for permitting the user to interactively
specify constraints among top-level window sizes and positions.  Nearly
all decorations can be changed at run-time on a per-window basis.
Dynamic loading of C modules is supported.  Scwm is self-documenting and
provides A powerful protocol for interacting with the window manager
from other processes
