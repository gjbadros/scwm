Scwm 0.5 is released.

* What scwm is:

Scwm is the Scheme Configurable Window Manager. This is a highly
dynamic and extensible window manager (based originally on fvwm, but
now much enhanced) with Guile Scheme as the configuration/extension
language. Nearly all decorations can be changed at run-time or
per-window, and eventually many decoration styles and additional
features will be supported through dynamically loaded code.
