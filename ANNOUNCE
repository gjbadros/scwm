Scwm 0.7 is released.

* What scwm is:

Scwm is the Scheme Configurable Window Manager. This is a highly
dynamic and extensible window manager for the X Window System (based
originally on fvwm2, but now much enhanced) with Guile Scheme as the
configuration/extension language. Nearly all decorations can be
changed at run-time or per-window, and eventually many decoration
styles and additional features will be supported through dynamically
loaded code. A powerful protocol is provided for interacting with the
window manager while it is running.
