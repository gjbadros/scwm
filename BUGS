raised? (and in general, get-window) fails with scwmsend's property communication mechanism


! functions should be renamed to end with _x

Possibly stop making resizes account for decorations, so that maximize
is happier.

there needs to be a way to remove mouse bindings; unbind_key added 10/24/97, gjb

should initially focus/hilight some window (also a bug in fvwm2).

callbacks should run from a new dynamic root.

FIXED:

start interactive moves and resizes right, so that initial mouse motion is not
lost.  ~ 10/15/97, MS
