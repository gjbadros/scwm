gjb gets this on recapture
[Scwm][ScwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 54, Error 4, EventType: 2
                                    XFreePixmap 
This could be due to the recapture code losing track of the pixmap due
to some change I made in the pixmap code --11/08/97 gjb

Possibly stop making resizes account for decorations, so that maximize
is happier.

callbacks should run from a new dynamic root. [ huh? --11/08/97 gjb ]

RESOLVED:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

should initially focus/hilight some window (also a bug in fvwm2)
  -- Fixed by adding CoerceEnterNotifyOnCurrentWindow()

Memory allocation errors can occur if guile was built with Rx support;
autoconf sets this option if it finds a librx.{a,so} in the paths it
checks. --11/08/97 gjb

Passing a bad window from guile can cause scwm to dump core in
ensure_valid(); MS says fixed ~ 11/1/97


functions should be renamed to end with _x 
  -- This looks done... is it not? --11/08/97 gjb

(get-window) acts wierdly when a window needs to be selected, or
when executed via scwmsend's property mechanism -- was a problem with
DeferExecution();  not sure if it's completely right now, but seems to
work in the cases I've tried -- 10/25/97, gjb

there needs to be a way to remove mouse bindings; unbind_key added 10/24/97, gjb

start interactive moves and resizes right, so that initial mouse motion is not
lost.  ~ 10/15/97, MS
