select-window is unimplemented

! functions should be renamed to end with _x

start interactive moves and resizes right, so that initial mouse motion is not

Possibly stop making resizes account for decorations, so that maximize
is happier.

procedures that start with get- probably should not.

there needs to be a way to remove bindings.
