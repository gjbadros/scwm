select-window is unimplemented

handle errors on events properly - currently we crash :-(

! functions should be renamed to end with _x

handle submenus correctly in make-menu

start interactive moves and resizes right, so that initial mouse motion is not
lost.

Possibly stop making resizes account for decorations, so that maximize
is happier.
