1. I pop up an xterm
2. I do a horizontal-toggle-maximize
3. I change to a smaller font.
4. The window automatically resizes due to 3, preserving the number of rows & columns.
5. I do a horizontal-toggle-maximize again to bring it back to normal size.
6. The window resizes to many more rows and columns than it originally
   had.  It ends up about the same size in pixels, though.

Evidentally toggle-maximize isn't differentiating between windows
sized in characters & windows sized in pixels.

Shouldn't toggling back to the original size go back to the orignal
number of rows & columns, not the original size in pixels?  If I
recall correctly, that's what fvwm does.

Windows still aren't positioning correctly for me at startup.  They're
starting too low (when positioned with -0, as in:

xterm -j -sb -sl 128 -si -geometry 82x48-0-0 -T $XTERMNAME &
xterm -j -sb -sl 128 -si -geometry 80x24+0-0 -T $XTERMNAME &

The 1st xterm also ends up a little to far to the right (looks like
it's off by the window border).

This is with "guile 1.3a" (snap 980630), & a cvs update this morning
of scwm.

I've noticed this off-and-on with 0.6, and just noticed again with
0.7: My xterms have #:focus 'sloppy set; sometimes (probably about
one time in 25), when I have a pair of partially overlapping
windows and I move the cursor quickly from the root window,
crossing one of the xterms (which held the sloppy focus), and
landing in the other xterm, the new window does not gain focus.
I have to take the cursor off of the window in which I desire
focus and bring it back in, crossing the border slowly.

- Another window shade problem: clients that resize themsleves while
shaded make the wm lose. [ reported by Oleg Tihnov ]
------------
- Click to focus bugs

1a. At startup usually a window, which I don't want given focus,
   gets focus.

1b. The same is true on a restart.  Except sometimes no window gets
   focus at all, which makes life difficult for `next'.

2. When I quit a X app, the focus is usually given to a window I don't 
   want to have focus.

There seems to be a bug in window size (or allowable size) 
communication between scwm & applications. 
 
For example, bring up a netscape window.  Maximize its height.  It 
very nicely stretches from the top of the window to the bottom.  Now 
start giving it lots of Alt-Ns to pop up new netscape windows. 
Netscape always starts up new windows the same size as the netscape 
window last created or adjusted in size.  So, all the windows being 
poped up should be the same size.  However, each window poped up ends 
up one pixel larger in height.

windows having a different border-width than the default (6) are
placed incorrectly if they have SE gravity. They are several pixels
[(6-border_width)*2] off the screen-border.

This is due to the fact that `PlaceWindow' is called before the
evaluation of window-styles. `PlaceWindow' needs to be called if the
border-width changed (from `set_border_width_x', or `SetupFrame', or
whatever). It would be nice if the call to `PlaceWindow' before the
window is properly styled could then be removed, but I don't know what
this could break.

- Animated window-shade bug, reported by Sam Steingold <sds@gnu.org>,
exploit confirmed by MS, but I have no clue how to fix it right now:
Open 2 windows, one (1) partially obscuring the other's (2) title bar.
Double click on the (1)'s title bar, shading it.  You can see that the
portion of the (2)'s title bar with was obscured before but it not
obscured now is not repainted.  Also, if you move the mouse towards (2)
while (1) is being (animatedly ==> with delay) shaded, so that the (1)
is "pulled from under the mouse pointer", leaving it on (2), (2) will
*not* have the focus, although it should as per sloppy focus.
