! functions should be renamed to end with _x  -- This looks partially done...

Possibly stop making resizes account for decorations, so that maximize
is happier.

should initially focus/hilight some window (also a bug in fvwm2).

callbacks should run from a new dynamic root.

FIXED:

(get-window) acts wierdly when a window needs to be selected, or
when executed via scwmsend's property mechanism -- was a problem with
DeferExecution();  not sure if it's completely right now, but seems to
work in the cases I've tried -- 10/25/97, gjb

there needs to be a way to remove mouse bindings; unbind_key added 10/24/97, gjb

start interactive moves and resizes right, so that initial mouse motion is not
lost.  ~ 10/15/97, MS
