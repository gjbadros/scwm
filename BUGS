- Jim Blandy's patch to load boot-9 for newer guile versions is
problematic; it can't tell wether or not we are running under an older
guile which has already loaded boot-9, resulting in a segfault. - MS

- Click to focus bugs

1a. At startup usually a window, which I don't want given focus,
   gets focus.

1b. The same is true on a restart.  Except sometimes no window gets
   focus at all, which makes life difficult for `next'.

2. When I quit a X app, the focus is usually given to a window I don't 
   want to have focus.

gjb gets this on recapture
[Scwm][ScwmErrorHandler]: <<ERROR>> Request 54, Error 4, EventType: 2
                                    XFreePixmap 
This could be due to the recapture code losing track of the pixmap due
to some change I made in the pixmap code --11/08/97 gjb

Possibly stop making resizes account for decorations, so that maximize
is happier.

callbacks should run from a new dynamic root. [ huh? --11/08/97 gjb ]
[ this would prevent them from calling continuations that escape
outside the callback handler - the code would lose big on this -ms]

RESOLVED:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- buggy icon handling everywhere -- needs thorough testing
  -- 2-20-97 mstachow

should initially focus/hilight some window (also a bug in fvwm2)
  -- Fixed by adding CoerceEnterNotifyOnCurrentWindow()

Memory allocation errors can occur if guile was built with Rx support;
autoconf sets this option if it finds a librx.{a,so} in the paths it
checks. --11/08/97 gjb

Passing a bad window from guile can cause scwm to dump core in
ensure_valid(); MS says fixed ~ 11/1/97


functions should be renamed to end with _x 
  -- This looks done... is it not? --11/08/97 gjb	

(get-window) acts wierdly when a window needs to be selected, or
when executed via scwmsend's property mechanism -- was a problem with
DeferExecution();  not sure if it's completely right now, but seems to
work in the cases I've tried -- 10/25/97, gjb

there needs to be a way to remove mouse bindings; unbind_key added 10/24/97, gjb

start interactive moves and resizes right, so that initial mouse motion is not
lost.  ~ 10/15/97, MS

Oleg Tihonov <oleg@benetnash.ffke-campus.mipt.ru>'s bug re: bind-mouse
and unbind-mouse.  bind-mouse grabbed for all windows unnecessarily, and 
unbind-mouse did not permit `1' to mean moust button 1 --gjb 11/27/97
