Scwm requires autoconf 2.12, automake 1.3 and libtool 1.2 to generate
some of the automatically generated files for the build process. You
don't need these if you are just compiling a release or a snapshot,
but if you are going to hack on the code and change the Makefiles and
such, you will probably need them. They are available from:


autoconf 2.12: 
ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/autoconf-2.12.tar.gz

automake 1.3:
ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/automake-1.3.tar.gz

libtool 1.2:
ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/libtool-1.2.tar.gz

Some of these packages may be available as .rpm or .deb packages, or
other system-specific packages, but I haven't checked.


If you have these tools, and especially if you are hacking the CVS
version, it is strongly reccomended that you run configure with the
--enable-maintainer-mode flag - this will cause "make" to regenerate
automatically generated files as needed, including Makefiles, thus
largely removing the need to run the various "auto" tools by
hand. However, it may sometimes be necessary to do things by hand
anyway. In this case, you should follow the following steps (annotated
with what they actually do, to explain the maze of automatically
generated files):

## Generate aclocal.m4 from configure.in
$ aclocal

## Generate Makefile.in's from Makefile.am's and configure.in
## (adding missing files that may be needed for proper operation)
$ automake --add-missing

## Generate include/config.h.in from acconfig.h and configure.in
$ autoheader

## Generate configure from configure.in and aclocal.m4
$ autoconf

## Detect system parameters and generate Makefiles from Makefile.in's
## and include/config.h from include/config.h.in, enabling
## maintainer-specific rules.
./configure --enable-maintainer-mode

## Actually build the system
make

Just to recap, the steps are:

aclocal
automake --add-missing
autoheader
autoconf
./configure --enable-maintainer-mode
make

However, most of the time these steps should be unnecessary; as soon
as you have configured once with --enable-maintainer-mode, make should
do all of these automatically.
