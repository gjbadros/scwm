;;; hover-focus
;;;
;;; The hover-focus module provides a new window focus mechanism.  It
;;; allows a window to receive focus when the mouse pointer enters a
;;; window and remains ("hovers") over the window for a brief period
;;; of time.  The window can also be focused by clicking on the window
;;; just as with the "#:focus 'click" policy on which hover-focus is
;;; built.  Setting hover-focus for a window automatically changes
;;; that windows built-in focus style to 'click; resetting hover-focus
;;; for a window (i.e., turning it off) reverts the windows focus
;;; style back to whatever it was before turning hover-focus on.
;;; (intervening set-window-focus! commands will be undone).
;;;
;;; To make hover-focus the focus policy requires that hover-focus be
;;; included in a use-modules list, that the #:focus policy be set to
;;; 'click, and that the #:hover-focus option be set to #t.  The
;;; #:auto-raise option with no auto-raise-delay also works well with
;;; hover-focus.  A typical hover-focus window-style would begin:
;;;
;;; (window-style "*"
;;;    #:focus 'click
;;;    #:auto-raise #t #:auto-raise-delay 0
;;;    #:hover-focus #t  #:hover-focus-delay 350
;;;    ; plus other options to taste...
;;; )
