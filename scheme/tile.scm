Tiling places the windows according to a grid from START-POS, (0 0) by
default, to END-POS, the size of the display by default.

of WINDOWS will be operated on.

If ORDER is 'horizontal, the windows will be tiled in row-major order;

RESIZE may be #f, 'shrink-only or 'always, indicating that the windows
should never be resized, that they should be resized to the max-size
only if they are bigger, or that they should always be resized to the
max size. The default is 'shrink-only.

RAISE may be #f, #t, or 'restack-only, indicating that the windows
should not be moved in the stacking order; that they should be raised
on top of other windows and placed in the tile order with the upper
left window lowest in the stacking order; or that they should be
restacked as for #t but not raised above other windows,
