Fri Mar  6 02:50:47 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* fvwm-module.scm: Slight corrections to the extra argument stuff;
 	also, broadcast the page info to modules that request the window
 	list.

	* base.scm: A few changes to make menu-style work right.

	* fvwm-module.scm: Added optional other-args argument to module.

Thu Mar  5 00:33:50 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* fvwm-eval.scm: Added support for the KillMe fvwm module command,
 	so modules can kill themselves.

1998-03-04  Jens-Ulrik Petersen  <petersen@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp>

	* winlist.scm (circulate): Improved its behaviour when there is no 
	window with focus.

Mon Mar  2 23:49:19 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* std-menus.scm, wmconfig-menu.scm: minor fixes from Sam Steingold
 	<sds@usa.net>

Sun Mar  1 02:21:15 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Install the new modules.

	* fvwm-module.scm: A new module that allows fvwm2 modules to be
 	run from within scwm. The relevant procedures are run-fvwm-module
 	and kill-fvwm-module.

	* fvwm-eval.scm: A new module to support evaluating fvwm2rc
 	lanugage expressions. The primary use is for the fvwm module
 	support code. The principal export is fvwm-eval which takes a
 	string expression and optionally a module (as returned by
 	run-fvwm-module) and a window.

	* bincomm.scm: A new module for binary communication; it's
 	intended to be used by the fvwm module code, but code to support
 	other legacy module protocols may want to use it as well. It may
 	be helpful to rewrite this in C someday.

Sat Feb 28 01:34:28 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* image-loaders.scm: A new file that supports loading images in
 	foreig formats through several converters. Slower than native
 	loading, but better than nothing. Exported procedures are
 	ImageMagick-loader and netpbm-loader, which try to use their
 	namesake packages to convert the image to xpm and then try to load
 	it, try-everything-loader which tries both in order and will
 	support any other available conversion methods in the future, and
 	support-image-conversion, a simple wrapper which establishes
 	try-everything-loader as the default loader.

	Makefile.in: Install image-loaders.scm.

	* Makefile.in: Install wmconfig-menu.scm, std-menus.scm
	
	* base.scm: Added run-in-xterm from Sam Steingold <sds@usa.net>

	* std-menus.scm: Renamed the former xlock-menu.scm to this and
 	added make-hosts-menu, a useful menu for a set of hosts to telnet
 	to.

	* wmconfig-menu.scm: Added documentation and miscellaneous fixes
 	from Sam Steingold <sds@usa.net>.

Wed Feb 25 21:39:58 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* wmconfig-menu.scm: New module contributed by Sam Steingold
 	<sds@usa.net> - this provides the function make-wmconfig-menu,
 	which parses the Red Hat 5.0 /etc/X11/wmconfig directory and
 	returns a mennu which reflects its contents. The title and name of
 	the menu, and the directory to scan, may optionally be specified
 	in that order. Appropriate defaults are provided.

	* xlock-menu.scm: New module contributed by Sam Steingold - the
 	key exciting bit is the make-xlock-menu function which creates a
 	menu with several xlock screensaver choices. The optional argument
 	specifies wether or not to lock the screen when launching
 	screensavers; the default is #f.

	* base.scm: Added fold-menu-list and exe, contributed by Sam
 	Steingold.
	
	fold-menu-list takes a menu and an optional number of lines, and
 	splits it at that number of lines (or 30 by default), adding
 	"more..."-labeled submenu entries. exe is just a wrapper around
 	execute that returns a procedure which will run the specified
 	command.

	* minimal.scm: Changed load-font reference to make-font

	* base.scm: Changed references to load-font to use make-font
 	instead; defined load-font as make-font for compatability;
 	font-property function for getting single properties of a font.

Fri Feb 20 04:42:04 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* base.scm: Added image-property convenience wrapper to get at
 	individual image properties.

	* style.scm: Added #:show-icon and #:force-icon options, removed
 	some crufty old comments.

Fri Dec 12 16:15:28 1997  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Permit a string action in a menuitem to mean (execute
 	string), permit string color-bg and color-text in a menu, use
 	'menu-text-color, 'menu-bg-color, and 'menu-font as the defaults
 	so they can be redefined later -- note that the user must still
 	define these variables in their .scwmrc before building menus or
 	else the quoted symbol doesn't work (symbol table scope issue due
	to modules?)

Sun Nov 30 11:56:30 1997  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Use new menuing interface: menu-title and
 	menu-separator are new variables, (menu ..) and (menuitem ..) are
 	new public definitions

	* minimal.scm: Use new primitive menu interface -- make-menu and
 	make-menuitem.

	* winlist.scm: Make show-window-list-menu use new menuing
 	interface

Mon Nov 10 05:43:11 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* fvwm-compat.scm: In fvwm-pipe-read, use dup to properly connect
 	the pipe to the standard output for the subprocess.
	
	* style.scm: Use make-image in lieu of make-picture.

Mon Nov 10 00:16:04 1997  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: added toggle-window-shade-animated

Sun Nov  9 16:45:50 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* base.scm: Added a new more abstract syntax for menu items to
 	allow more flexibility in changing the menu implementation;
 	procedures menu-title, menu-separator and menu-item should be used
 	to specify menu items instead of explicitly passing symbols or
 	lists.

	* style.scm: stop using set-icon-maybe-name! and
 	set-mini-icon-maybe-name! and comment them out; would rather have
 	string handling in the primitvs for now.

Sat Nov  8 20:35:26 1997  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* style.scm: allow pixmaps or strings in window styles

Fri Nov  7 03:26:00 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* base.scm: Renamed title-style to simple-title-style; the real
 	title-style is now in face.scm.

	* face.scm: New file face.scm which implements a friendlier
 	interface to title, button and border styles than the primitve
 	interface. The exported procedures are title-style, border-style
 	and button-style; they are somewhat analogous to the fvwm builtins
 	with similar names.

Mon Nov  3 01:12:41 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* decor.scm: Add the #:use-decor style option.

1997-10-31  Jens-Ulrik Holger Petersen  <petersen@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp>

	* winlist.scm (#:winlist-skip): add-boolean-style-option

1997-10-24  Jens-Ulrik Holger Petersen  <petersen@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp>

	* Makefile.in (mostlyclean): New target.

	* wininfo.scm (window-geometry-string): Format geometry output
	in standard way.

	* winlist.scm (winlist-skip?): Fixed; was constant #f.

Thu Oct 23 20:03:30 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* decor.scm: Added some basic support for decors: the
 	call-with-decor procedure and with-decor macro.

	* style.scm, style-options.scm, winlist.scm, winops.scm: Split
 	style.scm into styles.scm which provides the various style
 	commands and style-options.scm which provides the tables of style
 	options and hooks to add new ones. style.scm now does not need to
 	use every module that may define procedures that should be
 	available as style options; the files can just use the (app scwm
 	style-options) module and define relevant options themselves. This
 	was done for #:circulate-skip, #:circulate-skip-icon,
 	#:winlist-skip, and #:start-maximized.

Tue Oct 21 21:04:31 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* style.scm: Change #:mwm-buttons from a style option to a hint
 	option.

Mon Oct 20 06:10:38 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* winlist.scm: Circulate (and therefore prev-window and
 	next-window) were giving an error when no window in the window
 	list satisfied the given conditions.  This is now fixed. Bug
 	reported by Jens-Ulrik Holger Petersen
 	<petersen@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp>.

	* wininfo.scm: in-viewport-any-desk? and visible? were not working
 	correctly when the viewport is away from 0,0; this is fixed. Bug
 	reported by Jens-Ulrik Holger Petersen
 	<petersen@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp>.

Sun Oct 19 01:33:50 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Use mkinstalldirs to create the scwm scheme
 	directory if necessary.

Sat Oct 18 02:19:58 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* wininfo.scm: wildcard-matcher: reversed the order of the if and
 	then clauses in (if full-regexp ...). Patch from Mikael
 	Djurfeldt <mdj@nada.kth.se>

Fri Oct 17 18:18:55 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* style.scm: The 'new-window and 'new-window-hint event handlers
 	were changes to call the old handler first and then execute the
 	style hooks.
	
	Also, the #:lenience style option was added.

	* base.scm: Fixed a bug in move-viewport - the let syntax was
 	incorrect. Bug report and fix from Holger Petersen
 	<petersen@kurmis.kyotou.ac.jp>

	* Makefile.in: Added VPATH support.
