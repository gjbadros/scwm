Tue Sep  8 17:12:59 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* doc.scm: Added use of scwm-variables.txt, don't print "trying
	..." messages for each file -- comment out

Tue Sep  8 13:55:35 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Fix typo in close-window -- Thanks Dale Smith!

Tue Sep  8 10:39:59 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm, minimal.scm:  Remove uses of set-menu-mwm-style!, as
	that primitive and variable are gone now

	* fvwm-eval.scm: Fixed fvwm-command "Scroll" to use percent of
	screen, not number of pixels.  Thanks Dale Smith!

Mon Sep  7 13:47:14 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Document some user vars: xterm-command,
	remote-shell-command, default-menu-max-fold-lines (renamed from
	default-max-fold-lines)

Mon Sep  7 12:18:00 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Fix doc reference to set-title-justify!

Mon Sep  7 11:23:46 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

Sun Sep  6 16:20:20 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* auto-raise.scm: Added VAR comments, and move the vars into the
	root module.  Also added default-auto-raise-unfocus-delay instead
	of falling back to the default-auto-raise-delay since these delays 
	seem conceptually asymmetric to me

	* Makefile.am, user-options.scm:  added user-options.scm
	(autogenerated from doc/Makefile.am)

Sun Sep  6 15:37:45 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Mark variables with ;;;**VAR + comment

Sat Sep  5 15:34:59 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: fix unbalenced paren.
	
	* Makefile.am: Added sort.scm

	* winlist.scm, wininfo.scm, flux.scm: Document more procedures,
 	and rename var "w" to "win", "w2" to "win2"

Sat Sep  5 14:39:40 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* sort.scm: Added -- This may just be temporary until we start packaging
	some other useful procs from, e.g., slib

	* bincomm.scm, decor.scm, winops.scm: Document more procedures

Sat Sep  5 13:21:02 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Fix typo of extra paren -- thanks Juha Pohjalainen!

Fri Sep  4 18:57:49 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Added docs for some user variables, and document
	them a bit better.  Very tentative format.  In particular, it'd be 
	better if doc strings worked on variables (are they supposed to?)

Fri Sep  4 18:54:56 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* tests/constraint-stacking.scm, test/fvwm2-modules.scm: Added

Fri Sep  4 11:52:12 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm (window-viewport-position):  Check for sticky windows
	and handle them correctly.

Fri Sep  4 08:44:31 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Make display-area a variable, and use display-width, 
	display-height

	* fvwm-module.scm: Added debug-fvwm-module var, turn on
	non-blocking, make more public function for debugging.

	* fvwm-eval.scm: Use move-window-viewport-position synonym instead
	of move-to. Use display-width, display-height vars

	* fvwm-compat.scm: Use display-width, display-height vars

	* doc.scm: put doc-files in the root module

	* bincomm.scm: binary-write was using default port of
	current-input-port, not current-output-port. fixed.

	* base.scm: Define vars display-width, display-height and use
	them. 

1998-09-03  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* tests/test.scm (test-case): Add TITLE argument.

	* tests/properties.scm: Use it.
	Test `X-property-set!' with NAME != TYPE.

Thu Sep  3 15:21:17 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Fix docs of move-to -- it uses a viewport position;
	added move-window-viewport-position as a synonym for move-to

	* fvwm-eval.scm: Reindent.

Wed Sep  2 17:15:37 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm (flash-window): Make it restore the background color
	properly, and make it also set the highlight background color
	(uses the new primitives get-window-colors,
	get-highlight-window-colors, and set-window-highlight-background!

Wed Sep  2 13:31:50 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Do not assume a color is a string -- check first when
	redefining set-menu-{foreground,background}!

	* winops.scm: Added `resize-window' as a synonym for `resize-to'
	as the latter may soon be deprecated.

Wed Sep  2 11:56:36 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Put opaque-{resize,move}-percent in the root module
	by define-ing before the define-module (same hack as in base.scm)

	* prefs-menu.scm: Check scwm-is-constraint-enabled? for
	opaque-move menu -- use opaque-{move,resize}-percent variable

	* base.scm: Added `scwm-is-constraint-enabled?'

Wed Sep  2 10:57:00 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Added `X-cut-buffer-string'

Wed Sep  2 09:58:52 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Use window-viewport-position in
	popup-menu-from-decoration choosing where to put the menu on screen.

Tue Sep  1 16:31:25 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Added move-to, since move-window is the primitive that 
	move-to used to be.  move-to moves a window to a viewport
	position, move-window (the primitive) moves a window to a virtual position

	* winops.scm: Updated docs for animated-move-to.

1998-09-01  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* tests/test.scm: New file containing testing facilities.

	* tests/properties.scm: Use them.

1998-08-31  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* flux.scm, wininfo.scm: Scheme sources adapted to new X property
	interface.

	* tests/properties.scm, tests/window-opns.scm: Removed tests for
	old X property interface, added some for the new one. 

Tue Aug 25 14:37:43 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* optargs.scm: Preserve docstrings for precedures defined by
 	lambda* (and therefor define* and define*-public).

Fri Aug 21 15:59:15 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ALL: Added $Id$ as first line, canonicalize copyrights (add
	1998, me where appropriate)

	* flux.scm, face.scm, bincomm.scm, base.scm, auto-raise.scm: Added
 	some documentation, changed formal param "w" to "win" as useful.

Fri Aug 14 19:24:34 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* wininfo.scm, wmconfig-menu.scm: Document a proc in each.

Fri Aug 14 17:13:35 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Added vars `opaque-move-percent' and
	  `opaque-resize-percent', procs `window-frame-area' and
	  `display-area', user-procs `resize-opaquely?' and
	  `move-opaquely?', and procs `interactive-move-maybe-opaque', 
	  `interactive-resize-maybe-opaque', `move-or-raise-maybe-opaque', 
	  `resize-or-raise-maybe-opaque'.  Document toggle-maximize.

	* std-menus.scm, prefs-menu.scm: Use new form of run-in-xterm w/
	  key arg xterm-options

	* flux.scm: use-module winops, and use
	  interactive-{move,resize}-maybe-opaque when doing
	  interactive-{move,resize}s

	* base.scm: Drop xterm-command to just "xterm", and make
	  run-in-xterm now take #:xterm-options STRING to give options to
	  the xterm program.  It is assummed that "-e" is used as the
	  argument to invoke the CMD.  Also added `scwm-user-var' macro as 
	  a means at dynamically looking up a variable in
	  `the-root-module'.  This may not be the right way to do this--
	  feedback is appreciated.
	
Thu Aug 13 16:20:43 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* minimal.scm: Document all functions.

Thu Aug 13 16:04:20 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Document all public functions.  The define*-public
	  docstrings aren't accessible, though, and the emacs interface
	  seems to not permit %x as a procedure name.  Also changed
	  run-in-xterm to have the -e option already, and fixed std-menus
	  and prefs-menu for that convention.

	* prefs-menu.scm, std-menus.scm: Above mentioned fix to uses of
	  run-in-xterm.

Thu Aug 13 11:19:40 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* wininfo.scm: Fix percent visible to use window-frame-size, not
	  window-size

Wed Aug 12 17:21:31 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm, flux.scm: move "animated-move-to" into here (from
	  flux), and use (app scwm base) module

	* wininfo.scm: Added intersection-area and percent-visible from
	  Todd Larson, and use them in rectangle-overlap?

Wed Aug 12 15:31:33 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Use resize-frame-to and window-frame-size for
	  maxmize function

	* wininfo.scm: Use window-frame-size, except for
	  window-geometry-string which now uses the size in resize-inc
	  units

	* flux.scm, base.scm: Use window-frame-size for w%x, w%y, etc.

Fri Aug  7 17:57:49 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* stacking.scm: Add this new module with list-windows-above,
 	list-windows-below, raise-window-above (corrected from previous
 	version), lower-window-below, lower-by-one and raise-by-one.

	* winops.scm: Remove raise-window-above and lower-window-below
 	from here.

	* winlist.scm: Add #:by-stacking keyword arg to list-windows, and
 	show-window-list-menu.

	Also, since `pick' reverses the result, reverse it again.

	* wininfo.scm: Add windows-overlap? procedure to determine if two
 	windows overlap. Add window-overlaps-window? wrapper for this
 	which basically Currys it.
	

1998-08-07  Robert Bihlmeyer  <e9426626@stud2.tuwien.ac.at>

	* style.scm: First shot at making squashed-titlebar available as
	  a style option. s-t rocks.

Thu Aug  6 19:26:36 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* wininfo.scm: Fix from Todd Larason <jtl@molehill.org> to use the
	  display-size coordinates minus 1 as args to rectangle-overlap?

Wed Aug  5 20:13:15 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* wininfo.scm: Fix wildcard->regexp to turn ? into ., instead of
	  into .?; rename window-machine-name to window-client-machine-name

	* minimal.scm: Fixes to resize-or-raise and move-or-raise by
	  Stephen Tell.  Do not raise unless it's not a move or resize
	  event.

	* flux.scm: Added get-wm-command,
	  make-string-usable-for-resource-key, and S.Senda's make-rhosts-menu.

Sun Aug  2 16:31:41 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Added lower-window-below, raise-window-above as
	  front-ends to restack-windows.

	* wininfo.scm: added MSFIX: re: wildcard converter.  Added
	  window-machine-name (ideally this could get exposed to an
	  improved wildcard-matcher that distinguishes among Class,
	  Resource, Title, Icon-name, Window-machine-name, etc).

	* flux.scm: Added printable-char->keysym-string and use it to make 
	  X-synthetic-send-string work with embedded spaces, newlines,
	  etc.  It's a very primitive keyboard macro facility, now.  Added 
	  color->string as an accessor to the name property of a color
	  color->object.

	* doc.scm: Need to use (app scwm flux) for write-all

1998-08-01  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny3-12.ix.netcom.com>

	* fvwm-module.scm (send-mini-icon-packet): Use cdr-assq, not assq
	(and define it above). This should fix Greg's recently reported
	bug w/ mini-icons.

1998-08-01  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny4-24.ix.netcom.com>

	* fvwm-eval.scm ("ClickTime"): Replace set-click-time! with
	set-click-delay!

1998-07-31  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny5-12.ix.netcom.com>

	* base.scm, face.scm, fvwm-eval.scm, minimal.scm: Replace
	set-window-font! with set-title-font!

1998-07-31  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny3-12.ix.netcom.com>

	* base.scm (set-edge-resistance!, set-edge-scroll!,
	set-edge-wrap!): Added these convenience wrappers, but people
	should migrate to the new versions.

1998-07-30  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny3-12.ix.netcom.com>

	* decor.scm (#:use-decor): Deal with reversing the arguments to
	set-window-decor! for this style option.

	* fvwm-eval.scm: Major improvements from Danius Michaelides
	<danius@duff.org>; many more fvwm commands are now supported. See
	the end of the file for the complete support status.

Thu Jul 30 20:21:18 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Added select-multiple-windows-interactively (plus
	example with restack-windows), and select-window-from-window-list
	(plus example)

	* prefs-menu.scm: Cleanup a bit for lack of set-opaque-move-size!
	-- no real attempt to make the new parameter functional, though

Wed Jul 29 19:20:46 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* doc.scm: Added
	
	* flux.scm: Move doc-files and documentation into doc.scm; Added
	  find-window-by-name and window-bottom from Harvey Stein.

Mon Jul 27 20:07:17 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: use opaque moves by default, for
	  interactive-move-window-with-pointer, etc.

	* Added opaque-interactive-move, opaque-interactive-resize;
	improve messages on warning callbacks

1998-07-24  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Use string-append, duh.

1998-07-23  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Added new doc-files variable setting to use the new
	(scwm-path-prefix) primitive.  (For the new `documentation'
	procedure which accesses scwm-procedures.txt)

1998-07-23  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny1-20.ix.netcom.com>

	* fvwm-module.scm (add-window): Determine the icon file
	correctly. Thanks to Danius Michalides for the bug report.

1998-07-21  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny4-02.ix.netcom.com>

	* fvwm-module.scm: New interface to launching fvwm2 modules. This
	should be a better base for fvwm2 emulation, as well as a more
	convenient interface for users. Added/renamed/modified:

	variable: fvwm2-module-path 

	register-fvwm2-module-config MODULE-TYPE . ARGS

	append-fvwm2-module-config MODULE-TYPE . ARGS
	clear-fvwm2-module-config MODULE-TYPE
	get-fvwm2-module-config MODULE-TYPE
	run-fvwm2-module MODULE-NAME #&optional OTHER-ARGS CONFIG-INFO
	  CONFIG-FILE
	kill-fvwm2-module FMOD
	kill-all-fvwm2-modules
	kill-fvwm2-modules-by-name MODULE-NAME

	See the comment at the top of the file for more details.
	
Tue Jul 21 14:31:08 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* tests/constraints.scm: Added sample of how to write constriants
	using embedded cassowary constraint solver. Constraints are now
	available at the scheme in nearly their full generality.

1998-07-20  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny5-21.ix.netcom.com>

	* fvwm-module.scm: Ignore SIGPIPE if using fvwm modules; they have
	a tendency to break the pipe when you kill them w/o sending KillMe
	(at least for me) for some reason.

	* base.scm (color-property): Added color-property
	procedure. Reversed order of key and object on image-property and
	font-property to be consistent and Schemey.

1998-07-20  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@localhost.localdomain>

	* fvwm-eval.scm ("WarpToWindow"): Make the fvwm2 "WarpToWindow"
	command pick a window to warp to if none specified. Kind of
	stupid, but complete.

	* fvwm-module.scm: Support the broadcast-mini-icon-hook. Also,
	make send-window-list send the complete list of information, just
	like fvwm2 sends it. Many things were missing before.
	
	* fvwm-module.scm (run-fvwm-module): Make sure to do something
	more sensible when reciving a packet that specifies no
	window. Patch from Danius Michaelides <danius@duff.org>

	* fvwm-eval.scm: Handle the case where no window is specified more
	gracefully. Add support for Exec, Restart, Quit, Resize, Lower,
	and WarpToWindow fvwm commands. Add support for a special Eval
	command; this lets Fvwm modules evaluate arbitrary Scheme
	expressions, allowing for FvwmButtons configs for instance, to be
	very flexible. Patch from Danius Michaelides <danius@duff.org>
	
1998-07-15  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny2-12.ix.netcom.com>

	* style.scm: Added #:placement-proc and #:transient-placement-proc
	style options, to allow setting user-defined placement
	procedures. See C code directory ChangeLog for rationale on
	splitting these, and what procedures may be used from within a
	placement proc.

Mon Jul  6 01:51:30 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* auto-raise.scm: Replaced window-from-window-id with id->window.

	* fvwm-module.scm: Removed now useless definition of id->window.

1998-07-06  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* prefs-menu.scm: Added animation-ms-delay define, since it must
	be known before the prefs-menu definition.

	* flux.scm: add an extra menu-separator after menu-title, to make
	look more like the prefs-menu and xlock-menu

1998-07-04  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* std-menus.scm: Use xlock-query-program to decide what to run to
	query the modes for the screensaver

	* base.scm: comment out the remove-hook! macro, since there is
	also code that defines the macro iff it's not already defined;
	add reset-hook! macro
	set invalid-interaction-hook and cannot-grab-hook to ring the bell 
	with (beep)

1998-06-26  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny1-21.ix.netcom.com>

	* fvwm-module.scm(run-fvwm-module): Add a few sanity checks to
	make sure running a nonexistent module won't break things.

1998-06-23  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny1-07.ix.netcom.com>

	* std-menus.scm: Use the (ice-9 regex) module. 

1998-06-20  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@localhost.localdomain>

	* fvwm-module.scm: Use the new input hook system (add-input-hook!
	and remove-input-hook!, instead of using add-input-hook and
	counting on the hook being a one-shot).

Wed Jun 10 02:19:58 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* auto-raise.scm, flux.scm: minor typos fixed, thanks to Shuji
 	Narazaki <narazaki@dai.comp.kyutech.ac.jp> for the bug report and
 	patch.

Mon Jun  1 20:34:30 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: regenerated with automake 1.3

Thu Apr  2 18:08:09 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* minimal.scm: Set the rubber band mask to something better so the
 	rubber band actually shows up on 16bpp and higher systems by
 	default. Bug report from Francesco Tapparo
 	<f.tapparo@vi.nettuno.it>.

Mon Mar 30 15:38:00 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* auto-raise.scm: New auto-raise module. The #:auto-raise,
 	#:auto-raise-delay, #:auto-raise-focus-proc,
 	#:auto-raise-unfocus-proc and #:auto-raise-unfocus-delay window
 	style options added by this module control auto-raise. Still not
 	as general as I'd like (it should be possible to set an arbitrary
 	number of independent focus-unfocus pairs so you could do typical
 	autoraise and the maximize-unmaximize hack independently with
 	different timeouts), but will e eventually. See the file for
 	exaple usage.

	Makefile.in: Install auto-raise.scm

Sun Mar 29 18:19:57 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* fvwm-module.scm: Define and export kill-all-fvwm-modules which
 	kills all active fvwm modules; add it to the shutdown hook.

	* style.scm: Use new-style new-window hooks.

	* minimal.scm: Remove reliance on old-style new-window hooks;
 	they're not really needed anymore anyway, AddWindow should set
 	default colors of some sort.

Sun Mar 29 10:47:24 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Add transient? to window-info

	* fvwm-eval.scm: Fix typo that showed up with FvwmWinList

Sun Mar 29 15:04:31 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* base.scm: Add thunk macro.

	* base.scm: Only define remove-hook! if not already defined by
 	Guile.

Fri Mar 27 19:25:19 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* fvwm-module.scm: Use the new interface for broadcast hooks.

	* base.scm: Added remove-hook! to complement guile's add-hook!.

Thu Mar 26 11:32:29 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* fvwm-module.scm: Send more information to the module in
 	send-window-list (still not quite all that fvwm sends). Also a few
 	minor bug fixes. FvwmWinList now works.

	* fvwm-eval.scm: Added support for "Focus" and "Iconify" fvwm
 	builtins, reportedly needed by TkDesk.

Wed Mar 25 14:38:03 1998  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: use-module (ice-9 regex)

	* prefs-menu.scm: define-module misnamed the module -- removed
	trailing `s' from the name so prefs-menu matches the file name.
	Also added a comment about ask-string and how it might work...

Tue Mar 24 16:43:32 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.in (install): install flux.scm

Tue Mar 24 16:09:00 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* fvwm-compat.scm: Added all the FvwmM4 simple macros like
 	X_RESOLUTION, and CLASS

	* flux.scm: added sleep-ms and X-synthetic-send-string

Tue Mar 24 14:15:16 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* fvwm-module.scm: Append newlines to the configuration strings;
 	this is needed to make the pager happy with geometry
 	specifications and maybe other things. Bug report and patch from
 	Bucky LaDieu <nega@vt.edu>.

Mon Mar 23 15:47:45 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Added flux.scm: Pulled out a bunch of
	functions from gjb.scwmrc (many originally from sds.scwmrc) and
	put here so we could share them better as we decide how to
	migrate the functionality into standard functionality (or do
	something different).

Wed Mar 11 21:05:11 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* fvwm-compat.scm, bincomm.scm, fvwm-module.scm: Use close-port
 	instead of close for guile 1.2 compatablility. Bug report from
 	Bucky LaDieu <nega@vt.edu>.

Tue Mar 10 22:39:58 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>
	
	* fvwm-compat.scm: Added a bunch of commented out functions for
 	FvwmM4 pre-defines; these need to be fleshed out, but I wanted to
 	get the code started so I could see/think about what new
 	primitives we'll need to support the defines.

Fri Mar  6 02:50:47 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* fvwm-module.scm: Slight corrections to the extra argument stuff;
 	also, broadcast the page info to modules that request the window
 	list.

	* base.scm: A few changes to make menu-style work right.

	* fvwm-module.scm: Added optional other-args argument to module.

Thu Mar  5 00:33:50 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* fvwm-eval.scm: Added support for the KillMe fvwm module command,
 	so modules can kill themselves.

1998-03-04  Jens-Ulrik Petersen  <petersen@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp>

	* winlist.scm (circulate): Improved its behaviour when there is no 
	window with focus.

Mon Mar  2 23:49:19 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* std-menus.scm, wmconfig-menu.scm: minor fixes from Sam Steingold
 	<sds@usa.net>

Sun Mar  1 02:21:15 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Install the new modules.

	* fvwm-module.scm: A new module that allows fvwm2 modules to be
 	run from within scwm. The relevant procedures are run-fvwm-module
 	and kill-fvwm-module.

	* fvwm-eval.scm: A new module to support evaluating fvwm2rc
 	lanugage expressions. The primary use is for the fvwm module
 	support code. The principal export is fvwm-eval which takes a
 	string expression and optionally a module (as returned by
 	run-fvwm-module) and a window.

	* bincomm.scm: A new module for binary communication; it's
 	intended to be used by the fvwm module code, but code to support
 	other legacy module protocols may want to use it as well. It may
 	be helpful to rewrite this in C someday.

Sat Feb 28 01:34:28 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* image-loaders.scm: A new file that supports loading images in
 	foreig formats through several converters. Slower than native
 	loading, but better than nothing. Exported procedures are
 	ImageMagick-loader and netpbm-loader, which try to use their
 	namesake packages to convert the image to xpm and then try to load
 	it, try-everything-loader which tries both in order and will
 	support any other available conversion methods in the future, and
 	support-image-conversion, a simple wrapper which establishes
 	try-everything-loader as the default loader.

	Makefile.in: Install image-loaders.scm.

	* Makefile.in: Install wmconfig-menu.scm, std-menus.scm
	
	* base.scm: Added run-in-xterm from Sam Steingold <sds@usa.net>

	* std-menus.scm: Renamed the former xlock-menu.scm to this and
 	added make-hosts-menu, a useful menu for a set of hosts to telnet
 	to.

	* wmconfig-menu.scm: Added documentation and miscellaneous fixes
 	from Sam Steingold <sds@usa.net>.

Wed Feb 25 21:39:58 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* wmconfig-menu.scm: New module contributed by Sam Steingold
 	<sds@usa.net> - this provides the function make-wmconfig-menu,
 	which parses the Red Hat 5.0 /etc/X11/wmconfig directory and
 	returns a mennu which reflects its contents. The title and name of
 	the menu, and the directory to scan, may optionally be specified
 	in that order. Appropriate defaults are provided.

	* xlock-menu.scm: New module contributed by Sam Steingold - the
 	key exciting bit is the make-xlock-menu function which creates a
 	menu with several xlock screensaver choices. The optional argument
 	specifies wether or not to lock the screen when launching
 	screensavers; the default is #f.

	* base.scm: Added fold-menu-list and exe, contributed by Sam
 	Steingold.
	
	fold-menu-list takes a menu and an optional number of lines, and
 	splits it at that number of lines (or 30 by default), adding
 	"more..."-labeled submenu entries. exe is just a wrapper around
 	execute that returns a procedure which will run the specified
 	command.

	* minimal.scm: Changed load-font reference to make-font

	* base.scm: Changed references to load-font to use make-font
 	instead; defined load-font as make-font for compatability;
 	font-property function for getting single properties of a font.

Fri Feb 20 04:42:04 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* base.scm: Added image-property convenience wrapper to get at
 	individual image properties.

	* style.scm: Added #:show-icon and #:force-icon options, removed
 	some crufty old comments.

Fri Dec 12 16:15:28 1997  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Permit a string action in a menuitem to mean (execute
 	string), permit string color-bg and color-text in a menu, use
 	'menu-text-color, 'menu-bg-color, and 'menu-font as the defaults
 	so they can be redefined later -- note that the user must still
 	define these variables in their .scwmrc before building menus or
 	else the quoted symbol doesn't work (symbol table scope issue due
	to modules?)

Sun Nov 30 11:56:30 1997  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Use new menuing interface: menu-title and
 	menu-separator are new variables, (menu ..) and (menuitem ..) are
 	new public definitions

	* minimal.scm: Use new primitive menu interface -- make-menu and
 	make-menuitem.

	* winlist.scm: Make show-window-list-menu use new menuing
 	interface

Mon Nov 10 05:43:11 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* fvwm-compat.scm: In fvwm-pipe-read, use dup to properly connect
 	the pipe to the standard output for the subprocess.
	
	* style.scm: Use make-image in lieu of make-picture.

Mon Nov 10 00:16:04 1997  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: added toggle-window-shade-animated

Sun Nov  9 16:45:50 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* base.scm: Added a new more abstract syntax for menu items to
 	allow more flexibility in changing the menu implementation;
 	procedures menu-title, menu-separator and menu-item should be used
 	to specify menu items instead of explicitly passing symbols or
 	lists.

	* style.scm: stop using set-icon-maybe-name! and
 	set-mini-icon-maybe-name! and comment them out; would rather have
 	string handling in the primitvs for now.

Sat Nov  8 20:35:26 1997  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* style.scm: allow pixmaps or strings in window styles

Fri Nov  7 03:26:00 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* base.scm: Renamed title-style to simple-title-style; the real
 	title-style is now in face.scm.

	* face.scm: New file face.scm which implements a friendlier
 	interface to title, button and border styles than the primitve
 	interface. The exported procedures are title-style, border-style
 	and button-style; they are somewhat analogous to the fvwm builtins
 	with similar names.

Mon Nov  3 01:12:41 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* decor.scm: Add the #:use-decor style option.

1997-10-31  Jens-Ulrik Holger Petersen  <petersen@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp>

	* winlist.scm (#:winlist-skip): add-boolean-style-option

1997-10-24  Jens-Ulrik Holger Petersen  <petersen@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp>

	* Makefile.in (mostlyclean): New target.

	* wininfo.scm (window-geometry-string): Format geometry output
	in standard way.

	* winlist.scm (winlist-skip?): Fixed; was constant #f.

Thu Oct 23 20:03:30 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* decor.scm: Added some basic support for decors: the
 	call-with-decor procedure and with-decor macro.

	* style.scm, style-options.scm, winlist.scm, winops.scm: Split
 	style.scm into styles.scm which provides the various style
 	commands and style-options.scm which provides the tables of style
 	options and hooks to add new ones. style.scm now does not need to
 	use every module that may define procedures that should be
 	available as style options; the files can just use the (app scwm
 	style-options) module and define relevant options themselves. This
 	was done for #:circulate-skip, #:circulate-skip-icon,
 	#:winlist-skip, and #:start-maximized.

Tue Oct 21 21:04:31 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* style.scm: Change #:mwm-buttons from a style option to a hint
 	option.

Mon Oct 20 06:10:38 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* winlist.scm: Circulate (and therefore prev-window and
 	next-window) were giving an error when no window in the window
 	list satisfied the given conditions.  This is now fixed. Bug
 	reported by Jens-Ulrik Holger Petersen
 	<petersen@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp>.

	* wininfo.scm: in-viewport-any-desk? and visible? were not working
 	correctly when the viewport is away from 0,0; this is fixed. Bug
 	reported by Jens-Ulrik Holger Petersen
 	<petersen@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp>.

Sun Oct 19 01:33:50 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Use mkinstalldirs to create the scwm scheme
 	directory if necessary.

Sat Oct 18 02:19:58 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* wininfo.scm: wildcard-matcher: reversed the order of the if and
 	then clauses in (if full-regexp ...). Patch from Mikael
 	Djurfeldt <mdj@nada.kth.se>

Fri Oct 17 18:18:55 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* style.scm: The 'new-window and 'new-window-hint event handlers
 	were changes to call the old handler first and then execute the
 	style hooks.
	
	Also, the #:lenience style option was added.

	* base.scm: Fixed a bug in move-viewport - the let syntax was
 	incorrect. Bug report and fix from Holger Petersen
 	<petersen@kurmis.kyotou.ac.jp>

	* Makefile.in: Added VPATH support.
