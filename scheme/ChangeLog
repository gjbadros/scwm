Mon Jan 10 14:04:03 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* prompt-binding.scm: Change the way copy and insert work so that
	subsequent deletes delete the right row.  For some reason,
	delete's notion of the selected row didn't match with what was
	highlighted on screen.  The current situation is unsurprising, but 
	less than ideal, since a copy/insert leaves the copied line
	highlighted instead of switching to the copy of that line.

Mon Jan 10 13:16:33 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Document `bell'

Sun Jan  9 20:51:45 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* style.scm: Added more docs to `window-style', and let it take a
	list of '(ClassName ResourceName).

	* placement.scm: Added `auto-accept-dialog-placement'

	* netscape.scm: Added `enable-autosave-netscape-dialog',
	`disable-autosave-netscape-dialog'.  Use new format for
	window-style commands.  Eliminate top-level executive of
	window-style command.

Sun Jan  9 19:03:20 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* gtk.scm: Added `use-gtk-error-window-for-scwm' procedure, and
	have it use done-startup to ensure that the hooks aren't added
	prematurely.

	* base.scm: Remove adding procs to invalid-interaction-hook and
	cannot-grab-hook.  Define bell in terms of beep using a function,
	not in terms of the proc variables.

	* animation.scm: Use export, instead of (define-public foo foo)

Sun Jan  9 17:55:08 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* animated-iconify.scm: Fix `animated-deiconify-to-viewport' to
	just use `animated-deiconify' when the window is sticky.

Sun Jan  9 17:37:01 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xprop-extras.scm: Added `propagate-selection-to-cut-buffer'

	* netscape.scm: Parameterize selection stuff based on the
	selection, but have it default to "PRIMARY".  Added
	`netscape-google-search-selection-url'.

Sun Jan  9 17:21:52 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* modifier-key-bindings.scm: Added better comments, drop
	unbind-keycode-ignore-procs since that is now a capability of the
	primitive. 

	* fvwm-module.scm: ws change.

	* base.scm: `caught-error' need not be define*-public, just define-public.

Sun Jan  9 16:25:43 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xprop-extras.scm: Added `X-handle-selection-string' (nicer
	interface to `X-convert-selection' primitive).

	* winops.scm: Added some debug code to `maximize' and no longer
	reset gravity to 'northwest after a maximization.

	* netscape.scm: Added `netscape-goto-selection-url'.

	* bincomm.scm: Added some debugging code.

	* stringops.scm: Use base module for `color-property'.  Thanks
	Harald Meland!

Sat Jan  8 17:50:08 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* describe.scm: Added `describe-event', and factor out
	`display-binding' from all the `describe-*' procedures.  Also
	export `is-mouse-event?'

Sat Jan  8 17:15:09 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* prompt-proc.scm: Added helper procs
	`gtk-scrolled-window-set-vadjustment-value',
	`gtk-scrolled-window-set-hadjustment-value'

	* prompt-binding.scm: Get binding and unbinding to actually work.
	Use new `get-next-event' primitive to grab mouse and keyboard
	bindings.  Do some error checking.  Rename toplevel window to
	"Scwm Bindings" (was "Bindings")

	* base.scm: Added `caught-error' procedure for generating nice
	messages in error handlers.

Sat Jan  8 13:23:58 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* prompt-binding.scm: Make the Insert, Copy, Change, and Delete
	binding buttons dtrt to the binding clist, but still do not change 
	the actual bindings.  Added `clist-set-row-text' helper function.

Fri Jan  7 17:56:31 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* prompt-binding.scm: Use "Complex" instead of empty for the
	non-immediate mouse event type.  Added a middle pane (the bottom
	of the top pane, really) containing the current line for editing
	purposes. Make its set and grab buttons active.  Getting close to
	functional... 

Fri Jan  7 11:25:35 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* fvwm-module.scm: Added `raise-fvwm2-pager', `lower-fvwm2-pager'
	and rewrote `fvwm2-pager-window' to be a bit better.

Fri Jan  7 08:03:55 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* constraint-investigator.scm: Better alignment.

Fri Jan  7 07:58:14 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* time-convert.scm: Added msec->usec and sec->usec (for usleep,
	which still takes microseconds).

Wed Jan  5 15:51:54 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Added orientation option to
	two-window-or-more-nonant-prompter.  Change make-ui-cnctr-align's
	argument to a symbol from a string.

	* nonants.scm: Update `get-window-with-nonant-interactively' to
	respect the orientation and highlight whole edges for, e.g.,
	alignment constraints.

Wed Jan  5 12:46:59 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* constraint-investigator.scm: Make the enable/disable all
	constraints buttons draw all the constraints.  (makes it easier to 
	make the screenshot in the AAAI paper).

Tue Jan  4 16:41:41 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Added `set-highlight-colors!'

	* constraint-investigator.scm: Rearrange lines in the table-- put
	the checkbox at the far left.  Make the checkbox *and* the label
	both display the visualization of the constraint when hovered over 
	(using an event box).  Removed old `make-cn-button' private
	function that was not being used.

Mon Jan  3 09:25:33 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Set the window-list-proc to
	`focus-change-warp-pointer'. 

	* winlist.scm: Improve docs of `next-window'

Mon Jan  3 08:51:26 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Highlight the current selected
	window.  GJB:FIXME:: this is a hack -- shouldn't effect
	*everything* like it currently does.

	* task-switcher.scm: Fix typo bug.

	* netscape.scm (netscape-google-search): Bug fix from Alexandre
	Duret-Lutz.  Thanks!
