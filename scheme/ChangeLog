	* constraint-investigator.scm: Better alignment.

Fri Jan  7 07:58:14 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* time-convert.scm: Added msec->usec and sec->usec (for usleep,
	which still takes microseconds).

Wed Jan  5 15:51:54 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Added orientation option to
	two-window-or-more-nonant-prompter.  Change make-ui-cnctr-align's
	argument to a symbol from a string.

	* nonants.scm: Update `get-window-with-nonant-interactively' to
	respect the orientation and highlight whole edges for, e.g.,
	alignment constraints.

Wed Jan  5 12:46:59 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* constraint-investigator.scm: Make the enable/disable all
	constraints buttons draw all the constraints.  (makes it easier to 
	make the screenshot in the AAAI paper).

Tue Jan  4 16:41:41 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Added `set-highlight-colors!'

	* constraint-investigator.scm: Rearrange lines in the table-- put
	the checkbox at the far left.  Make the checkbox *and* the label
	both display the visualization of the constraint when hovered over 
	(using an event box).  Removed old `make-cn-button' private
	function that was not being used.

Mon Jan  3 09:25:33 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Set the window-list-proc to
	`focus-change-warp-pointer'. 

	* winlist.scm: Improve docs of `next-window'

Mon Jan  3 08:51:26 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Highlight the current selected
	window.  GJB:FIXME:: this is a hack -- shouldn't effect
	*everything* like it currently does.

	* task-switcher.scm: Fix typo bug.

	* netscape.scm (netscape-google-search): Bug fix from Alexandre
	Duret-Lutz.  Thanks!
