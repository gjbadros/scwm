Wed Feb 16 19:20:10 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops-menu.scm: Added `window-applications-menu' and
	`set-window-applications-menu!' and added #:application-menu
	window style (now depends on style-options module).  Use the
	window-application-menu in the window ops menu, so use filter-list 
	to remove it if there is no application menu.

	* winops-menu.scm: Added `netscape-application-menu', and use it
	as an #:application-menu

	* winops-menu.scm: Make `filter-map' skip unspecified values,
	too (not just #f values).  Added `filter-list'.

Wed Feb 16 18:28:45 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am (scwm_common_scheme): Added easyraise.scm

	* base.scm: Make action procedures of menuitems interactive.

	* easyraise.scm: Added; an alternative to stays-on-top windows.

Sun Feb 13 09:53:25 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* minimal.scm: Added module-loaded-hook, call it from
	use-scwm-module-note-success.

Sun Feb 13 09:13:23 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Added interactive decl for
	`toggle-maximize-horizontal'.

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Reordered constraint classes to put
	strict-relative-position second, making it second from the right
	in the toolbar (next to anchor) since it is parameterized based on 
	where the click occurs, like the other 3 rightmost buttons.

	* auto-shrink.scm: Added some documentation.

Mon Feb  7 17:06:45 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Added auto-shrink.scm

	* auto-shrink.scm: A module that auto-shrinks windows that haven't
 	received the focus in a while.  Very alpha right now.  Inspired by
 	a paper that I've not yet read --- thanks to Tessa Lau for
	pointing me at it: http://www.elsevier.nl/gej-ng/10/23/72/31/29/27/abstract.html

Mon Feb  7 14:10:35 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am, auto-unobscure.scm: Added.  Do cool stuff on
	window-fully-obscured-hook;  implementation is a bit like
	auto-raise.scm.

	* flux.scm: Added `eval-expression-interactively',
	`resize-xdvi-full-page-100%'.

Mon Feb  7 10:00:04 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops-menu.scm: Switch close and destroy menuitems so close is
	the bottom-most one (since it is easier to get to using Shift-Down 
	to select the last item).

	* ui-constraints-composition.scm, ui-constraints-buttons.scm,
 	constraint-investigator.scm: ui-constraints-gtk-toggle-menu
 	changed to constraints-investigator.

Tue Feb  1 14:17:16 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* style.scm: Drop `deiconify-window' from the start-iconified
	window style;  when it's false, just do nothing.  This is perhaps
	the right behaviour, but also works around a bug in drawing ghost
	frames for iconified windows when restarting.  A better fix might
	change Deiconify() in window.c.

Wed Jan 26 16:50:44 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* placement.scm: Added `at-virtual-offset-placement'.

	* minimal.scm: Use immediate-proc for bind-mouse calls so that,
	e.g., the root-menu pops up more quickly.

Wed Jan 26 10:50:17 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* placement.scm: Added `at-vp-offset-placement'

Sat Jan 22 17:19:00 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux-gtk.scm: Added * to either end of
	`show-window-list-matching-interactively' so it does a regexp
	substring search by default.  Make `bookmark-grep' just do nothing 
	when no string is entered in the prompt.

Thu Jan 20 12:27:17 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* std-menus.scm: `execute-on-selection', `exe-on-selection' now
	use `X-handle-selection-string' instead of just using the cut
	buffer. 

	* netscape.scm: Added `netscape-av-search',
	`netscape-av-search-selection-url' for AltaVista searches.

	* flux-gtk.scm: Needs file and netscape modules.

Sun Jan 16 16:37:56 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am (scwm_gtk_scheme): Added gtk-table-display.scm

	* gtk-table-display.scm: Added, for formatting a text string into
	rows and columns of a table -- used by netscape-bookmark-search.

	* gtk.scm, prompt-proc.scm: Move some helper functions into (app
 	scwm gtk) module from prompt-proc.

	* flux-gtk.scm: Added `chop-string' and
	`netscape-bookmark-search', use gtk-table-display-module.

Sat Jan 15 15:18:10 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm, winlist.scm: Move window-list-proc into base.scm from
 	winlist.scm.  Reduces some circular dependency issues.

Sat Jan 15 12:38:56 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* netscape.scm: Fix bogus docs for `cgi-escapify-space'.

Wed Jan 12 00:28:56 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops-menu.scm: Added `make-menu-focus-options'

	* winlist-menu.scm: Added `show-netscape-window-list-menu'

	* placement.scm: Added `make-keep-winclass-centered'

	* flux-gtk.scm: ws change.

	* base.scm: Added `viewport-center-x', `viewport-center-y'

Tue Jan 11 18:15:39 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Make some fns interactive that weren't.

Tue Jan 11 18:09:47 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window-configuration.scm: Make `push-window-configuration',
	`pop-window-configuration' interactive.

	* shove-window.scm: Make shoving first push-window-position.

	* quote.scm: Added `quote-next-event', needs describe.scm to do so.

Tue Jan 11 13:27:53 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* netscape.scm (netscape-google-search): Let word == #f mean just
	go to google home page.  This better handles the case of no
	selection.

Tue Jan 11 09:30:39 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am, gtk-message.scm: Added.  Original version contributed by
	Francesco Tapparo -- thanks Francesco!

Mon Jan 10 17:09:47 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* fvwm-module.scm: Make `raise-fvwm2-pager', `lower-fvwm2-pager'
	interactive. 

Mon Jan 10 14:04:03 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* prompt-binding.scm: Change the way copy and insert work so that
	subsequent deletes delete the right row.  For some reason,
	delete's notion of the selected row didn't match with what was
	highlighted on screen.  The current situation is unsurprising, but 
	less than ideal, since a copy/insert leaves the copied line
	highlighted instead of switching to the copy of that line.

Mon Jan 10 13:16:33 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Document `bell'

Sun Jan  9 20:51:45 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* style.scm: Added more docs to `window-style', and let it take a
	list of '(ClassName ResourceName).

	* placement.scm: Added `auto-accept-dialog-placement'

	* netscape.scm: Added `enable-autosave-netscape-dialog',
	`disable-autosave-netscape-dialog'.  Use new format for
	window-style commands.  Eliminate top-level executive of
	window-style command.

Sun Jan  9 19:03:20 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* gtk.scm: Added `use-gtk-error-window-for-scwm' procedure, and
	have it use done-startup to ensure that the hooks aren't added
	prematurely.

	* base.scm: Remove adding procs to invalid-interaction-hook and
	cannot-grab-hook.  Define bell in terms of beep using a function,
	not in terms of the proc variables.

	* animation.scm: Use export, instead of (define-public foo foo)

Sun Jan  9 17:55:08 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* animated-iconify.scm: Fix `animated-deiconify-to-viewport' to
	just use `animated-deiconify' when the window is sticky.

Sun Jan  9 17:37:01 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xprop-extras.scm: Added `propagate-selection-to-cut-buffer'

	* netscape.scm: Parameterize selection stuff based on the
	selection, but have it default to "PRIMARY".  Added
	`netscape-google-search-selection-url'.

Sun Jan  9 17:21:52 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* modifier-key-bindings.scm: Added better comments, drop
	unbind-keycode-ignore-procs since that is now a capability of the
	primitive. 

	* fvwm-module.scm: ws change.

	* base.scm: `caught-error' need not be define*-public, just define-public.

Sun Jan  9 16:25:43 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xprop-extras.scm: Added `X-handle-selection-string' (nicer
	interface to `X-convert-selection' primitive).

	* winops.scm: Added some debug code to `maximize' and no longer
	reset gravity to 'northwest after a maximization.

	* netscape.scm: Added `netscape-goto-selection-url'.

	* bincomm.scm: Added some debugging code.

	* stringops.scm: Use base module for `color-property'.  Thanks
	Harald Meland!

Sat Jan  8 17:50:08 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* describe.scm: Added `describe-event', and factor out
	`display-binding' from all the `describe-*' procedures.  Also
	export `is-mouse-event?'

Sat Jan  8 17:15:09 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* prompt-proc.scm: Added helper procs
	`gtk-scrolled-window-set-vadjustment-value',
	`gtk-scrolled-window-set-hadjustment-value'

	* prompt-binding.scm: Get binding and unbinding to actually work.
	Use new `get-next-event' primitive to grab mouse and keyboard
	bindings.  Do some error checking.  Rename toplevel window to
	"Scwm Bindings" (was "Bindings")

	* base.scm: Added `caught-error' procedure for generating nice
	messages in error handlers.

Sat Jan  8 13:23:58 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* prompt-binding.scm: Make the Insert, Copy, Change, and Delete
	binding buttons dtrt to the binding clist, but still do not change 
	the actual bindings.  Added `clist-set-row-text' helper function.

Fri Jan  7 17:56:31 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* prompt-binding.scm: Use "Complex" instead of empty for the
	non-immediate mouse event type.  Added a middle pane (the bottom
	of the top pane, really) containing the current line for editing
	purposes. Make its set and grab buttons active.  Getting close to
	functional... 

Fri Jan  7 11:25:35 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* fvwm-module.scm: Added `raise-fvwm2-pager', `lower-fvwm2-pager'
	and rewrote `fvwm2-pager-window' to be a bit better.

Fri Jan  7 08:03:55 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* constraint-investigator.scm: Better alignment.

Fri Jan  7 07:58:14 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* time-convert.scm: Added msec->usec and sec->usec (for usleep,
	which still takes microseconds).

Wed Jan  5 15:51:54 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Added orientation option to
	two-window-or-more-nonant-prompter.  Change make-ui-cnctr-align's
	argument to a symbol from a string.

	* nonants.scm: Update `get-window-with-nonant-interactively' to
	respect the orientation and highlight whole edges for, e.g.,
	alignment constraints.

Wed Jan  5 12:46:59 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* constraint-investigator.scm: Make the enable/disable all
	constraints buttons draw all the constraints.  (makes it easier to 
	make the screenshot in the AAAI paper).

Tue Jan  4 16:41:41 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Added `set-highlight-colors!'

	* constraint-investigator.scm: Rearrange lines in the table-- put
	the checkbox at the far left.  Make the checkbox *and* the label
	both display the visualization of the constraint when hovered over 
	(using an event box).  Removed old `make-cn-button' private
	function that was not being used.

Mon Jan  3 09:25:33 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Set the window-list-proc to
	`focus-change-warp-pointer'. 

	* winlist.scm: Improve docs of `next-window'

Mon Jan  3 08:51:26 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Highlight the current selected
	window.  GJB:FIXME:: this is a hack -- shouldn't effect
	*everything* like it currently does.

	* task-switcher.scm: Fix typo bug.

	* netscape.scm (netscape-google-search): Bug fix from Alexandre
	Duret-Lutz.  Thanks!
