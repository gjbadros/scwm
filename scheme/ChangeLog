1999-01-29  Jeff Nichols  <jwnichls@cs.washington.edu>

	* simple-constraints.scm: Folded "v" into the v-related function

	* window-locations.scm: Use (app scwm base), made return viewport
	positions instead of virtual positons

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Added new menuname-as-class-name,
	updated drawing procs, added some new constraint classes, some
	abstractions for drawing

	* ui-constraints-toggle-menu.scm: Use new menuname proc

	* ui-constraints.scm: Lowercase var names, change draw proc
	arguments, added menuname proc to ctr, use vector not lists

Fri Jan 29 09:34:58 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am (scwm_common_scheme): Regenerate the
	scwm_common_scheme variable automatically since it was way out of
	synch w/ the existing files list.  (Are the long lines a big
	problem for anyone?  or for Automake?)


1999-01-29  Sam Steingold  <sds@goems.com>

	* Makefile.am: install animate-iconify-window.scm.

Tue Jan 26 15:58:08 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* string-prompt.scm: Pack the prompt label in with expand set to
	false so only the entry widget expands when resized.

	* simple-constraints.scm: Added synopsis doc comments, declare
	variable v.

	* fvwm-module.scm: Make fvwm2-module-send-window-list private (I
	had made it public for debugging reasons long ago when I was more
	clueless about the module system).

1999-01-26  Sam Steingold  <sds@goems.com>

	* placement.scm (place-at-point-internal): call
	`move-inside-current-viewport'.

Mon Jan 25 17:35:13 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* message-window.scm: Fix `resize-message-new-size-hook' to take
	all the extra arguments I just added so the window can report in
	client units and pixel positions as well.

Mon Jan 25 16:55:02 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* animate-iconify-window.scm: Added
	animate-deiconify-to-current-viewport, wrote
	animate-iconify-or-deiconify in terms of a win-pos and win-size,
	not an explicit window---this better supports
	animate-deiconify-to-current-viewport.

	* virtual.scm: Added current-viewport-offset-xx,
	current-viewport-offset-yy, window-position-in-viewport, and
	deiconify-to-current-viewport

Sat Jan 23 17:43:35 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* animate-iconify-window.scm: Added.  Still issues remaining with
 	deiconify and viewports/desks.

Sat Jan 23 14:33:10 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Added MESSAGE-WINDOW argument to
	`select-window-interactively' to permit re-using an existing
	message window when prompting.

	* window-locations.scm: Have all the procs return point pairs, (X
	. Y) instead of lists of points.

	* ui-constraints-toggle-menu.scm: Flash the constrainted windows
	in addition to drawing the constraint representation.  Added
	"Enable all" and "Disable all" menu options.

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Cleaned up a lot -- use
	ui-constraint-prompter-msgwin and make it more obvious by
	default.  Use new versions of xlib-* procedures, and use
	two-window-prompter to factor out some commonality in prompting
	procedures.

	* ui-constraints-buttons.scm: Try to reduce the amount of extra
	padding in the button bar.  May illustrate a bug in Scwm's
	handling of no title bar.

	* ui-constraints.scm: Added `enable-all-constraints'.

	* message-window.scm: Bugfix -- interactive-move's were not
	displaying the message-window because
	msgwin-{enabler,disabler}-table had a cut & paste error.

	* gtk.scm: Added comment for scwm-gtk-sync.

	* flux.scm: Added proc-when-selected argument to
	`select-multiple-windows-interactively'.  Wrote
	`delete-multiple-windows-interactively'.

	* doc.scm: Make documentation-debug #f by default.

Sat Jan 23 10:49:43 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* constraints.scm: Use ui-constraints-toggle-menu, and bind it to C-M-S-c

	* ui-constraints-toggle-menu.scm: Added

Fri Jan 22 17:58:26 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* constraints.scm: Drop the window-style, since it used something
	from my .scwmrc

	* gtk.scm: Fix bug in `gtk-pixmap-new-search-scwm-path'

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Added keep-to-left-of, use
	indicative pixmaps

Fri Jan 22 17:14:44 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* constraints.scm: Added -- top level module for constraint
	support in Scwm

Fri Jan 22 16:29:45 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* gtk.scm: Added `gtk-pixmap-new-search-scwm-path' for finding
	pixmaps in image-load-path

	* window-locations.scm: Define `half' that does truncation and use
	it instead of dividing by 2 so we don't get floating point
	numbers.  Use `window-frame-size' not `window-size' (get values in
	pixels)

	* ui-constraints.scm: Added pixmap-name argument to
	make-ui-constraint-class, use it.  Drop draw-loop -- use map.
	Added `disable-all-constraints'.  Fix bug in diable-ui-constraint

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Added keep-above, fix drawing code
	to use window-locations module

	* ui-constraints-buttons.scm: Added tool-tips and pixmaps.

Fri Jan 22 16:17:14 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* modifier-key-bindings.scm: Added -- from scheme/tests/keycode.scm

Fri Jan 22 08:49:05 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints.scm: Use simple-constraints module, and refer to
	the solver using the new `scwm-master-solver' accessor instead of
	the variable `solver' from simple-constraints.scm

Fri Jan 22 08:43:51 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window-locations.scm, ui-constraints-classes.scm,
	ui-constraints-buttons.scm, simple-constraints.scm: Added

Thu Jan 21 12:05:10 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm (default-resize-opaquely, default-move-opaquely): Use
	<= for the test so 100% means full-size windows will work
	opaquely. Thanks Eli Barzilay!

Thu Jan 21 12:02:28 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* kwm-emulation.scm: Use X-PropertyNotify-hook to catch changes in
	KWM_WIN_ICONIFIED and honour them -- this makes the middle-button
	clicking on the task bar work.  Fix bug in initialization in
	SETTING of CURRENT_DESKTOP.  Remove kwm-kpanel-winid var, and
	rename kwm-module-windows to kwm-module-winids.  Fix -reset
	routine to remove the property hook handlers.

Wed Jan 20 16:53:01 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints.scm: Use error more pervasively.  Rename
	ui-constraint-enable to ui-constraint-enabled?. Use vectors of
	characters as obids (not strings). Make UI-CTR semantics be that
	it only returns the list of args for the real ctr.  Implement
	make-ui-constraint-interactively in terms of make-ui-constraint.
	Fix the returned constraint instance objects to have the enabled
	flag, the constraint-class object, etc., and update accessors to
	go to the right places.  Rewrote ui-constraint-windows to use
	cl-windows-of-constraint instead of building the window list into
	the ui-constraint instances (in case some of the arguments are not
	windows... I suppose we could put a real list of windows in the
	ui-constraint object using `window?').

Wed Jan 20 14:23:09 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints.scm: Bug fixes.  Use "error" instead of returning
	#f when wrong type argument; use set! to side-effect global --
	cons is side effect free; simplify ui-constraint? and
	ui-constraint-class? predicates -- use pair? not list?.
	Documentation still needs to be inside the procedures,
	ui-constraint-class still is wrong because the ui-constraint
	objects do not refer to their ui-constraint-class objects.

Wed Jan 20 13:23:23 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints.scm: Use delq, not remove-from-list, fix some
	typos, begin adding some documentation, begin using (error ..)
	instead of returning #f when accessors are called w/ wrong
	objects, etc.

Wed Jan 20 10:37:42 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints.scm: Added

	* kwm-emulation.scm: Some general clean up, try to handle
	window-list better, and try handling iconifications.

Mon Jan 18 15:33:41 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* string-prompt.scm: Added to provide string-prompting
	capabilities.  Still could use work, but is already useful in a
	limited way.

Mon Jan 18 13:44:32 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Fixed select-window-interactively-- it was badly
	broken from the message window rewrites

Sat Jan  9 11:27:10 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* animation.scm: Fix some of the example animated-move-to calls;
	'x, 'y are no longer valid -- uses #f instead to mean "no change"

Sun Dec 27 14:48:35 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* placement.scm: Several useful procedures that place windows
 	(place-in-viewport, place-on-desk, interactive-place,
 	place-at-point) and several that return placement procedures
 	according to various parameters (in-viewport-placement,
 	on-desk-placement, interactive-placement, at-point-placement,
 	virtual-switch-placement)

	* virtual.scm: Various useful things for viewport/desktop
 	management. Procedures to compute useful aligned/integral viewport
 	coordinates (containing-aligned-viewport,
 	nearest-aligned-viewport, window-aligned-viewport win); useful
 	functions for moving windows around relative to virtual space
	(move-window-to-viewport, move-inside-viewport,
 	move-inside-aligned-viewport, move-inside-current-viewport,
 	move-inside-own-viewport); procedures to set the current viewport
 	position in interesting higher-level ways (move-to-viewport,
 	align-viewport, warp-to-window-viewport); and a macro that saves
 	and restores teh current desktop and viewport
 	(save-virtual-excursion).

	* flux.scm (move-window-to-viewport, in-viewport, place-at-point,
 	move-inside): Removed; virtual.scm and placement.scm have more
 	general replacements (roughly bases on these).

	* base.scm (round/): New procedure that divides one number by
 	another and returns the nearest integer, useful to implement
 	percentages and integer division for coordinates. All the
 	%-procedures have been converted to use round/.

	* wininfo.scm (window-center-position): New procedure that returns
 	a list of the coordinates

1998-12-23  Sam Steingold  <sds@goems.com>

	* Makefile.am (scwm_common_scheme): reokaced
	move-resize-message-window.scm, move-with-message-window.scm,
	resize-with-message-window.scm,
	standard-move-resize-message-window.scm, with message-window.scm.
	(apparently Maciej forgot to check in Makefile.am).

Tue Dec 22 04:05:39 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* message-window.scm: Consolidate message window stuff. Added
 	`message-window-options' to allow enabling and disabling of
 	various message windows and customization of positioning/tracking
 	behavior, and `message-window-style' to provide the familiar
 	interface for setting the appearance of a message window.
	* resize-with-message-window.scm, move-resize-message-window.scm,
 	standard-move-resize-message-window.scm,
 	move-with-message-window.scm: Removed (obsoleted by
 	message-window.scm)
	* Makefile.am: install and distribute message-window.scm, do not
 	install or distribute resize-with-message-window.scm,
 	move-resize-message-window.scm,
 	standard-move-resize-message-window.scm,
 	move-with-message-window.scm.

1998-12-21  Todd Larason  <jtl@molehill.org>

	* desk-background.scm: simplification: fallback to default only if
	nothing is set for a desk, not for each component separately.
	This leads to both simpler code and more consistent/understandable
	behavior.

Sat Dec 19 02:42:52 1998  Carl R. Witty  <cwitty@newtonlabs.com>

	* wininfo.scm (title-match??, class-match??, resource-match??,
 	icon-title-match??, client-hostname-match??): Typo fix in doc.

1998-12-15  Todd Larason  <jtl@molehill.org>

	* Makefile.am (scwm_common_scheme): install message window files

	* desk-background.scm: use-module (app scwm optargs)

Sat Dec 12 00:15:14 1998  Carl R. Witty  <cwitty@newtonlabs.com>

	* winlist.scm (list-windows): Update doc.
	(winlist-skip?): Typo fix in doc.
	(show-window-list-menu): Update doc.

	* std-menus.scm (xlock-options): Made xlock very nice, instead of
	very greedy.

	* listops.scm (filter): Typo fix in doc.

	* flux.scm (make-file-menu): Changed default editor to emacs.
	(bool->str): Update doc.
	(find-window-by): New function.
	(find-window-by-name, find-window-by-class-resource): Rewritten to
 	use find-window-by.
	(use-change-desk-commands): Don't error if the vector isn't
	long enough.

	* base.scm (hotkeys-from-name): Don't error if the last letter
	is an '&'.

	* wininfo.scm (window-geometry-string): Update doc.
	(window-overlaps-window?): Update doc.

	* winops.scm (window-frame-area): Rewrite doc.

	* wininfo.scm (wildcard->regexp): Rewrite doc.

	(client-hostname-match??): Typo fix.

	* prefs-menu.scm (user-option-menuitem): Made non-public.

	* flux.scm (use-change-desk-commands): Rewrite doc.

	* face.scm (title-style, border-style, button-style): Update docs.

	* winlist.scm (should-circulate-skip?): Typo fix in doc.

	* doc.scm (documentation): Update doc.

1998-12-13  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* tests/session.scm: New file for SM tests.

1998-12-09  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* flux.scm (take-screenshot): New function.

1998-12-06  Todd Larason  <jtl@molehill.org>

	* desk-background.scm: initial implementation of a high-level
	interface for setting desktop backgrounds.

Sat Dec  5 12:26:47 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Fixed bugs in previous checkin's display-message-briefly

Sat Dec  5 12:05:31 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Added back in the menu-* variables to avoid order
	dependency in initialization;  added select-window-interactively
	to mimic the old primitive by the same name -- uses message window
	SMOBs now.

	* flux.scm: Rewrite display-message-briefly to use message-window
	SMOBs, add gravity->alignments proc since it's more generally useful

	* move-resize-message-window.scm, move-with-message-window.scm,
	resize-with-message-window.scm,
	standard-move-resize-message-window.scm:  Added -- by Jeff
	W. Nichols.  Supports previously-built-in support for message
	window display of move position and resize size during interactive
	moves and resizes.

1998-12-04  Todd Larason  <jtl@molehill.org>

	* animation.scm: doc update

	* base.scm: minor doc updates

	* cached-program-exists.scm: doc updates

	* doc.scm: doc update

	* face.scm: minor doc updates

	* flux.scm: documentation fixes

	* fvwm-eval.scm: documentation for eval-fvwm-command

	* fvwm-module.scm (end-window-list): no longer public

	* image-loaders.scm: documentation for image-loader functions

	* listops.scm: fix documentation of and-map and or-map to match
	actual funcationality

	* themes.scm: initial documentation

	* wininfo.scm: minor doc updates

	* winlist.scm (list-windows): workaround for scwmdoc bug

	* winops.scm: doc update

	All of the above are from Carl R. Witty <cwitty@newtonlabs.com>
	Thanks much!

1998-12-04  Sam Steingold  <sds@goems.com>

	* doc.scm (documentation): cleaned up.
	(doc-files): added more files.

Thu Dec  3 10:28:26 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* doc.scm, base.scm: Make no attempt to define user-settable
 	variables in the root module. That was only ever needed for
 	variables that the C code (brokenly) looked up with gh_lookup,
 	which we are not doing for any of the affected vars.

	* flux.scm: Replace uses of interactive-resize-maybe-opaque and
 	interactive-move-maybe-opaque with interactive-move and
 	interactive-resize respectively.

	* winops.scm: Replace interactive-resize-maybe-opaque and
 	interactive-move-maybe-opaque with interactive-move and
 	interactive-resize which take a optional boolean `opaquely?'
  	argument which defaults to the result of calling `move-opaquely?'
  	or `resize-opaquely?' on the argument. The former definitions of
 	those two predicates have been prefixed with `default-' and the
 	original names were defined as the `default-' versions; this is to
 	facilitate user documentation. set! hack-interactive-move and
 	hack-interactive-resize from minimal.scm to the non-hack versions
 	so they will work right automagically if you use this
 	module. Don't attempt to define any variables in the root
 	module. Various reordering and commenting.

	* minimal.scm: Use hack-interactive-move and
 	hack-interactive-resize, temporarily defined to the rubber-band
	versions, in complex operations.

	* tile.scm: Use raise parameter instead of restack; change default
 	to 'restack-only; fix documentation to say "tile" instead of
 	"cascade"; thanks to Eli Barzilay <eli@CS.Cornell.EDU>.

Wed Dec  2 08:42:49 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* tile.scm: New procedures `tile-windows' and `tile'. Similar to
 	cascade.scm, inspired by Andrew Veliath's FvwmTile.

Tue Dec  1 21:24:57 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* cascade.scm (cascade-windows): Don't nest a let* immediately in
 	a let, just use a let*.

	* Makefile.am (scwm_common_scheme): Make sure to install all
 	Scheme files (other than minimal.scm). Bug report from Carl
 	R. Witty (cwitty@newtonlabs.com).

1998-12-01  Sam Steingold  <sds@goems.com>

	* flux.scm (move-inside): new function: ensures that the window is
	inside the viewport.
	(place-at-point): new function: place the window at mouse point.

1998-11-22  Todd Larason  <jtl@molehill.org>

	* base.scm (scwm-user-var): change #:menu-look tag to #:look for
	(menu) form, to match (menu-style) and reduce redundancy

Fri Nov 20 15:06:59 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* animation.scm: Added doc comment that got lost when this got
	moved into a scheme file.  Changed the default for
	move-pointer-too to #t (since this takes viewport positions, I
	think it's justified, and matches the old behaviour)

Fri Nov 20 02:03:27 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* ScwmDeskButtons.scm: A trivial pager-like thing (still need to
 	find a way to color the button of the current desk differently).

	* ScwmClock.scm: Example scwmlet using guile-gtk, a sort-of
 	"xclock -digital" replacement.

	* tests/scwm-gtk.scm: Remove cruft unneeded w/ new interface,
	make a bit more interesting.

	* gtk.scm: New module to do all the grungework when you want to
 	use Gtk+ with scwm.

Wed Nov 18 03:32:19 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* auto-raise.scm: Various minor bug fixes; make unfocus-proc
 	actually work. Thanks to Craig Struble <cstruble@vt.edu> for the
 	bug report. Also, use window-focus-change-hook in lieu of
 	broadcast-hook. Minor doc tweak. Also, do not attempt to put
 	variables in the root module. That is not good.

Tue Nov 17 01:25:14 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* wininfo.scm: Really really fix the regexp/icase bug. Fix
 	confirmed by Craig Stuble.

Mon Nov 16 14:54:14 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Make sure all scheme files are noticed by `make
 	dist'.

	* wininfo.scm (define-string-matcher): Finally, a real fix for the
 	regexp/icase thing, from Craig Struble <cstruble@vt.edu>. Thanks!

1998-11-16  Sam Steingold  <sds@goems.com>

	* animation.scm (animated-move-to): use `display-height' and
	`cadr' for y instead of `display-width' and `car'.

Sun Nov 15 14:35:03 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* wininfo.scm (define-string-matcher): Try another way to pass
 	regexp/icase properly (whee).

	* shutdown-opts.scm: New module which exports shutdown-options
 	procedure, a way to configure whether you want scwm to switch to
 	viewport (0 0) and/or move all windows to the current viewport at
 	shutdown.

	Makefile.am: install it.

	* themes.scm, fvwm-modules.scm: Expect shutdown-hook procedures to
 	get a restarting? argument

	* wininfo.scm (define-string-matcher): Pass value of regexp/icase,
 	not the quoted symbol regexp/icase, to make-regexp. Bug report from
	Craig Struble <cstruble@vt.edu>.

Sat Nov 14 14:40:24 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am: install report-usage.scm

	* report-usage.scm: New file which has a function to log usage. If
 	this works, users could log usage by doing:

	(use-modules (app scwm report-usage))
	(report-scwm-usage)

	and we can remove support for logging usage from the core.

	* style.scm: Add back style-one-window.

	* animation.scm: Export set-animation!

1998-11-11  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* flux.scm (extreme): New function - calculates extreme values of
	predicates.

Tue Nov 10 10:02:02 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Fix netscape-new-window variable to use comment-based
	docstring, and added the closing paren that was missing (as
	noticed by Ken Pizzini)

Mon Nov  9 10:34:40 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Install animation.scm, themes.scm, theme-impl.scm

Sun Nov  8 17:59:23 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* themes.scm, theme-impl.scm: A start at implementing "themes",
 	i.e. packages that can be loaded into scwm setting only the look,
 	but not messing with the feel. Right now this handles only window
 	decorations and backgrounds. Menu support is one obvious thing
 	that needs to be added. However, theme support is being designed
 	to be flexible, so themes can be used per-window, and eventually
 	per-menu when menu support is added. See the new "themes"
 	directory in the distribution for example themes. Themes may be
 	directories, tar files, or gzipped tar files. themes.scm is meant
 	to be imported into a scwmrc; it provides `use-themes' for
 	handling global theme settings and a `#:use-theme' style option
 	for setting themes per-window. theme-impl.scm is meant to be
 	imported by theme control files and provides important
 	functionality for them.

	* minimal.scm: Some changes to minimize unnecessary hogging of
 	colors (don't define colors or things that reference them to
 	global variables).

Sat Nov  7 15:47:30 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* wininfo.scm: Export always? and never? predicates.

	* style.scm: Significant rewrite; use new representation of styles
 	which includes the test condition and which makes a chain of
 	styles itself a style; this will make theme support much easier
 	and will help add advanced features, like intelligent style
 	merging which will ensure you don't waste memory if you change
 	styles a lot. New exported procedures include `clear-style',
 	`make-conditional-style' and `apply-style', other than that the
 	interface is mostly the same. Also, `window-style' and friends
 	will now complain about bad keyword options.

	* style-options.scm: Change the way style options are stored;
 	abstract accessors style-option:handler, style-option:type and
 	style-option:cumulative should now be used to get info about style
 	options. The various procs for adding style options have extra
 	arguments for specifying type and the cumulative setting. A style
 	option is "cumulative" if setting it more than once should not
 	wipe out earlier settings, for instance #:use-style or
 	#:other-proc.

	* file.scm: Don't check if the file is a directory in
 	`find-file-in-path' or `filename-is-complete?'.

Wed Oct 28 00:03:55 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* cascade.scm: Fixed a bug in cascade (use raise, not restack to
 	test desired raise behavior).

	* cascade.scm: Added `cascade' and `cascade-windows', inspired by
 	Andrew Veliath's FvwmCascade module for fvwm. However, this
 	version is more flexible, takes one eighth the code, excluding
 	comments, and was coded and tested in two hours including
 	docs. For a good time, try binding something to
	(lambda () (cascade #:by-stacking #t #:reverse #t)).

Tue Oct 27 22:55:35 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* winlist.scm: Document #:reverse options.

	* winlist.scm: Add #:reverse optional argument to list-windows and
 	show-window-list-menu - you might very well want to go in the
 	reverse of the stacking order, for instance.

	* base.scm: Remove references to animatio-related options in
 	move-to.

	* animation.scm: Re-export animated-move-window,
 	animated-window-shade, and animated-window-unshade from the
 	c-animation module. Add animated-toggle-window-shade and
 	animated-move-to. Users should only need to import this module
 	directly, not c-animation, since it re-exports the primitives.

	* style.scm: Make #:start-window-shaded option use window-unshade,
 	not un-window-shade.

	* winops.scm: remove various -animated operations from here.

	* wininfo.scm: Numerous bug fixes to the new stuff here.

1998-10-23  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* flux.scm, prefs-menu.scm, std-menus.scm: Use `user-name' instead
	of `USER', `user-home' instead of `HOME'.

	* flux.scm: Remove `USER' and `HOME'.

Thu Oct 22 05:44:55 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Install listops.scm and file.scm

1998-10-20  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* tests/misc.scm: test-caseification of older tests.
	New tests for `user-name' and `user-home'.


Mon Oct 19 04:07:15 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* style.scm: Added default-style-condition-handler public variable
 	(set to window-match?? by default) which is the procedure applied
 	to string style conditions to get a predicate.

	Edited Greg's comment on this code to note he can now do this and
 	be happy:

	 (set! default-style-condition-handler class-match??)
	 (set! default-matcher-type 'regexp)


	* wininfo.scm: Added a new system of predicate makers which return
 	`eq?' predicates when given `equal?' arguments. This will become
 	important with some of the upcoming changes to style
 	handling. Predicates and meta-predicates added include:

	title-match?? STRING #&optional TYPE CASE-SENSITIVE
	class-match?? STRING #&optional TYPE CASE-SENSITIVE
	resource-match?? STRING #&optional TYPE CASE-SENSITIVE
	icon-title-match?? STRING #&optional TYPE CASE-SENSITIVE
	client-hostname-match?? STRING #&optional TYPE CASE-SENSITIVE

	  Each of these returns a predicate which matches an appropriate
 	aspect of a window to the given pattern string; TYPE may be
 	'exact, 'regexp or 'wildcard; CASE-SENSITIVE may be #t or #f.

	always? WIN
	  Returns #t for any value of WIN.
	never? WIN
	  Returns #f for any value of WIN.

	win-and?? . PREDICATES
	win-or?? . PREDICATES
	win-not?? PREDICATE
	  Returns a predicate that, when applied to a window, is the
 	logical and, logical or, or logical not of the application of
 	PREDICATES or PREDICATE. Some simplification is done.

	window-match?? STRING #&optional TYPE CASE-SENSITIVE
	  Does the logical or of `title-match??', `class-match??'
	and `resource-match??' on the same arguments. wildcard-matcher
	should be deprecated in favor of this.

	The public variables default-matcher-type and
 	default-matcher-case-sensitive control the default values of TYPE
 	and CASE-SENSITIVE in all the above.

	* optargs.scm: Fix minor bug that stress-testing with real scwm
 	runs found.

Sun Oct 18 16:14:59 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* listops.scm: Fix some argument name mismatches among
 	declarations, docstrings and bodies. Added `delete-duplicates'.

1998-10-18  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* base.scm: add menu-side-image, menu-side-bg-color,
	menu-side-bg-color-set and menu-bg-image variables,
	(set-menu-background!): if (not menu-side-bg-color-set), set
	menu-side-bg-color to the new menu bg color
	(set-menu-side-image!): new function
	(set-menu-side-background!): new function
	(set-menu-bg-image!): new function
	(menu-style): new tags #:bg-image, #:side-image and #:side-bg
	(menu): image-side, color-bg-image-side and image-bg change
	default values, to enable menu-style to set them

1998-10-17  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* flux.scm (position-message-window!): add a '.' to the end of the
	doc string

	* base.scm (set-menu-foreground!, set-menu-background!,
	set-menu-stipple!, set-menu-font!, set-menu-look!): added
	documentation
	(unset-message-window-position!): added '.' at end of doc string

1998-10-16  Sam Steingold  <sds@goems.com>

	* flux.scm (system-info-string): fix alignment.

Thu Oct 15 08:03:03 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm (maximize): Patch from Ken Pizzini to handle
 	partially off the left and top windows by moving them wholly on
 	screen when maximized

Wed Oct 14 00:39:02 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

 	* listops.scm: New file of list operations. Better than
  	common-list because: more traditional Scheme names and interfaces
  	are used and all implementations are tail-recursive. Should go in
  	guile-core someday, IMO.

  	winlist.scm, style.scm, fvwm-module.scm: use listops.scm instead
  	of common-list.scm; replace calls to `pick' with
  	`filter'. `filter' is better anyway, it doesn't reverse the result
  	like filter does.

 	* fvwm-module.scm: Remove `filename-is-full-path?' and
  	`find-file-in-path'.

 	file.scm: New file to segregate generic file operations that
 	should be more generally available. add `find-file-in-path' and
  	`filename-is-full-path?' (renamed to `filename-is-complete?').

1998-10-13  Robert Bihlmeyer  <e9426626@stud2.tuwien.ac.at>

	* std-menus.scm (context-map): New variable.
	(make-context-menu): New function.

	* flux.scm (execute-on-selection): New function.
	(exe-on-selection): New function.

	* advice.scm: Added a first shot at advising. This is probably not
	very usable yet. Some kind scheme guru should improve/reimplement
	this.

Sun Oct 11 17:40:15 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

 	* face.scm: Specify #&allow-other-keys for `title-style',
  	`border-style' and `button-style'.

 	* optargs.scm: New version supporting the following new features:

 		- More stringent error reporting for lambda* argment list
  		syntax.

 		- `#&rest' available as a synonym for `.' to specify a
  		rest argument.

 		- An error is reported if an unknown keyword argument is
  		passed to a procedure declared with #&key arguments,
  		unless `#&allow-other-keys' is specified in the
  		declaration.

 		- Better code is generated by the macros.

 		- `defmacro*' and `defmacro*-public' are provided; they
  		may be used to declare macros with optional or keyword
  		arguments.

Sat Oct 10 14:25:29 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Added `use-change-desk-commands' and make
	make-rhosts-menu a public function

1998-10-09  Sam Steingold  <sds@goems.com>

	* std-menus.scm (make-hosts-menu): accept a (host . command) as an
	element of host-list.

1998-10-07  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* base.scm (menu-style): treat #:font the same as the other options;
	new option #:look

1998-10-06  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* tests/menus.scm: update tests for new make-menu argument order

	* tests/menu-test.scm: update tests for new make-menu argument order

	* tests/arctic-theme.scm: test/demonstrate more of the ways menu
	looks can be created & used

	* minimal.scm: set-menu-foreground! and set-menu-background!
	primitives renamed set-not-menu-foreground! and
	set-not-menu-background!; set-menu-stipple! removed;  default-menu
	passes colors and font to make-menu as they're now required arguments

	* base.scm:
	new procedures: set-menu-stipple!, set-menu-font! and
	set-menu-look!
	(menu-stipple-color): new
	(menu-look): new
	(set-menu-foreground!): simplified; no need to wrap primitive
	(set-menu-background!): simplified; no need to wrap primitive
	(set-menu-stipple!): new
	(set-menu-font!): new
	(set-menu-look!): new
	(menu): #:color-stipple defaults to 'menu-stipple-color;
	#:menu-look added


1998-10-05  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* Makefile.am: install cached-programs-exists.scm

Mon Oct  5 12:55:58 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	#:show-last-focus-time option to show-window-list-menu

	* wininfo.scm: Added `time-t->seconds-ago' and use it in also
	added `window-last-focus-time-string'

Sun Oct  4 20:25:26 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* fvwm-eval.scm ("Exec"): Don't attempt to apply string-append to
 	args; it's one long string already. Thanks to Doug McNaught
 	<doug@tc.net>.

	Made "Echo" use `display' instead of `write'.

	* cached-program-exists.scm: Make cached-program-exists? check
 	debug-program-cache each time called so debugging can be turned on
 	dynamically; make debug-program-cache a public definition so the
 	user can `set!' it from his or her .scwmrc.

Sun Oct  4 16:51:29 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Use cached-program-exists module and
	cached-program-exists? procedure.  Also use new `first-word' on
	exename so that options to the executable are ignored

1998-10-01  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* flux.scm: renamed set-message-window-position-align! to
	position-message-window! per Greg's suggestion

	* base.scm (menu): add color-stipple and extra arguments

Wed Sep 30 13:57:14 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* fvwm-module.scm: Make debug-fvwm-module default to #f

Mon Sep 28 08:14:23 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Ken Pizzini's fixes to maximize to use client units,
	and have unmaximize only undo changes attributable to the last
	maximize action.

Sat Sep 26 20:38:30 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Added `background-system' from Jim Blandy, as an
	alternative to `scwm-system'.  We'll need to settle on one
	function for this, but both are now present

1998-09-25  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* flux.scm: Added set-message-window-position-align! as a more
	convenient interfact to set-message-window-position!.  A better
	name would be appreciated.

Thu Sep 24 12:07:09 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* style.scm: Go back to using after-new-window-hook instead of
	before-place-new-window-hook for the window styles.  Todd's patch
	may have fixed the placement-related bugs in a cleaner way.

Wed Sep 23 17:28:34 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* style.scm: Use before-place-new-window-hook instead of
	after-new-window-hook for styles (before-place-new-window-hook is
	new, to fix placement bug)

Wed Sep 23 11:11:58 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* minimal.scm: undefine X-grab-server, X-ungrab-server after
	with-grabbed-server is defined

	* base.scm: No longer define with-grabbed-server here -- do it in
	minimal.scm so we can undefine the primitives that are just used
	for writing it

	* flux.scm: Added find-window-by-class-resource

1998-09-22  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* flux.scm: use-module (app scwm wininfo) to get visible? defined;
	Added X-atomic-property-set-if-unset! implemented with
	with-grabbed-server primitive; Minor cleanup on run-in-netscape,
	and allowing a netscape window to be passed to send a command to a
	particular one.

	* base.scm: Added with-grabbed-server

Mon Sep 21 11:15:34 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Make flash-window take keyword args for color and
	unflash-delay, and use them instead of optional positional
	arguments.  Fixes `select-window-from-window-list' so that it
	correctly highlights the currently-selected window in its hover action

Mon Sep 21 10:28:48 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Added `select-window-group' to allow choosing multiple
	windows interactively.

Sat Sep 19 12:01:16 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Added `with-window-no-wind' macro, since there seems
 	to be a bug in extra calls to select window when
 	broadcast-config-hook is non empty and an interactive-move is
 	invoked inside a dynamically-wound with-window -- see
 	tests/with-window.scm;  drop answer var from with-window, since
	dynamic-wind returns the value of the middle thunk.

Fri Sep 18 15:57:18 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winlist.scm (show-window-list-menu): Added an
 	ignore-winlist-skip option

	* flux.scm: Added `netscape-goto-cut-buffer-url', `netscape-win';
	added ignore-winlist-skip option to
	`select-window-from-window-list'. Fix X-cut-buffer-string to
	return the car of the returned list, and verify that the property
	was a string.  Also added Todd Larason's way-cool
	`run-in-netscape'.

	* base.scm: make move-to handle sticky windows better.  Make
	`with-window' macro use dynamic-wind

1998-09-17  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* base.scm (unset-message-window-position!): Added, to move
	message window to default center-screen position

	* Makefile.am (ETAGS_ARGS): Build TAGS file from .scm files

Thu Sep 17 16:18:55 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* wininfo.scm (windows-overlap?): Use window-virtual-position, not
 	window-position, to take sticky windows into account, and for
	window-geometry-string

	* flux.scm: Fix move-window-to-viewport to be an absolute
	viewport, not a relative one, update docs.  Update
	window-info string to give both virtual and viewport information

	* base.scm: Added window-virtual-position, to give a virtual
	position even for sticky windows

Thu Sep 17 12:07:41 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Fix uses of WIN to be win.  Duh.

	* flux.scm (popup-menu-from-decoration): Don't inc y so much.

Thu Sep 17 11:05:33 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Extend printable-char->keysym-string to be (nearly?)
	complete -- the special characters now work for me.

Thu Sep 17 09:16:53 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Added `delta-position' and `move-window-relative' (the
	latter uses new `with-window' macro

	* base.scm:  Make bell an alias for beep (instead of a macro).
	Added `with-window' macro using new `set-window-context!' and
	`window-context' primitives

Wed Sep 16 08:56:14 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm (maximize, unmaximize): Use
 	move-window-viewport-position, instead of just move-window, and
 	use window-viewport-position to get the current position, instead
 	of window-position.

Tue Sep 15 09:37:57 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Added image-align option to `menu'.  Thanks Todd Larason!

Tue Sep 15 08:31:28 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: More changes to maximize from Ken Pizzini.  Gets the
	unmaximize to undo the maximize, while still moving minimally to
	perform the maximize.

Mon Sep 14 15:53:31 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* fvwm-module.scm (basename): Define if not provided by
	Guile.

Mon Sep 14 10:01:35 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Rework maximize, added unmaximize-no-move.  Thanks
	Ken Pizzini!

Sun Sep 13 19:29:10 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Fixed typo bug in X-synthetic-send-string -- use `win'
	instead of `w'

Sun Sep 13 13:00:37 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winlist.scm: Only use [un]flash-window-proc if not #f

Sun Sep 13 10:39:07 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Use window-viewport-position for maximize so
	max/unmaxed windows do not drift with the viewport-position

	* prefs-menu.scm: Fix typo in Sam's name

	* flux.scm: Added some doc comments, remove window-title-height
	and window-border-width -- use new less hacky versions

	* base.scm: Defined `window-title-{height,width}' in terms of new
	primitive `window-title-size'

Sat Sep 12 13:58:23 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Added `icon-viewport-position', use
	`virtual->viewport' for that and `window-viewport-position'

Fri Sep 11 17:08:01 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winlist.scm: Added {un,}flash-window-proc to
	show-window-list-menu so that we can do stuff like this:

 	(define (show-xterm-window-list-menu)
            (show-window-list-menu #:only
	        (lambda (w) (string=? (window-class w) "XTerm"))
			 #:warp-to-first #t
			 #:flash-window-proc flash-window
			 #:unflash-window-proc unflash-window))

	  to flash windows that are currently highlighted.  Needs better
	  configurability for hover timeouts, but that'll wait until after
	  the event rewrite, as menus may change a bit then.

Fri Sep 11 15:49:33 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Added `unflash-window', and make `flash-window' store
	old colors in scheme properties, instead of a lambda closure (for
	support of highlighting the current window using hover hooks in
	the menuing code [during window-list popups])

Fri Sep 11 13:41:03 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Added animated-move-window (taking virtual coords).

	* base.scm: Added a bunch of utility functions to the base
	module: viewport->virtual, virtual->viewport, viewport-size,
	viewport-{x,y}-position, vx-, vy-

Fri Sep 11 11:49:55 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Clean up comment for scwm-system, drop apply from
 	execlp call; Improve docs for x-, y-, and add
 	viewport-[xy]-position and vx-, vy- for virtual-coordinate
 	analogues of x- and y- (e.g., for move-window, which takes virtual
 	coordinates)

Thu Sep 10 14:39:46 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* wininfo.scm: Fix uses of window-position to use
	window-viewport-position as appropriate.  Added more
	documentation.

	* flux.scm: Added scwm-version-date to show-system-info

Thu Sep 10 11:08:53 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* wininfo.scm: simply reindented

	* prefs-menu.scm: Fix spelling in doc

	* flux.scm: Added `close-all-xlogo-windows'

	* fvwm-module.scm: Make add-window non-public again (changed for
 	debugging a while back), and give comment response (to MS's GJBFIX
 	note) about why o_nonblock is necessary on the output pipe.

Wed Sep  9 14:25:21 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Added `display-message-briefly'

Wed Sep  9 12:40:50 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Added use-scwm-system variable to control whether
	`system' or `scwm-system' is used.  Wrote `scwm-system' to work
	around a problem in my Linux system's "system" call which ends up
	having scwm/guile propagate a SIGINT to the child processes in the
	same process group.  Make execute use use-scwm-system to decide on
	using either `system' or `scwm-system'.

Tue Sep  8 17:12:59 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* doc.scm: Added use of scwm-variables.txt, don't print "trying
	..." messages for each file -- comment out

Tue Sep  8 13:55:35 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Fix typo in close-window -- Thanks Dale Smith!

Tue Sep  8 10:39:59 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm, minimal.scm:  Remove uses of set-menu-mwm-style!, as
	that primitive and variable are gone now

	* fvwm-eval.scm: Fixed fvwm-command "Scroll" to use percent of
	screen, not number of pixels.  Thanks Dale Smith!

Mon Sep  7 13:47:14 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Document some user vars: xterm-command,
	remote-shell-command, default-menu-max-fold-lines (renamed from
	default-max-fold-lines)

Mon Sep  7 12:18:00 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Fix doc reference to set-title-justify!

Mon Sep  7 11:23:46 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Fix scwm-is-constraint-enabled? proc

Sun Sep  6 16:20:20 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* auto-raise.scm: Added VAR comments, and move the vars into the
	root module.  Also added default-auto-raise-unfocus-delay instead
	of falling back to the default-auto-raise-delay since these delays
	seem conceptually asymmetric to me

	* Makefile.am, user-options.scm:  added user-options.scm
	(autogenerated from doc/Makefile.am)

Sun Sep  6 15:37:45 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Mark variables with ;;;**VAR + comment

Sat Sep  5 15:34:59 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: fix unbalenced paren.

	* Makefile.am: Added sort.scm

	* winlist.scm, wininfo.scm, flux.scm: Document more procedures,
 	and rename var "w" to "win", "w2" to "win2"

Sat Sep  5 14:39:40 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* sort.scm: Added -- This may just be temporary until we start packaging
	some other useful procs from, e.g., slib

	* bincomm.scm, decor.scm, winops.scm: Document more procedures

Sat Sep  5 13:21:02 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Fix typo of extra paren -- thanks Juha Pohjalainen!

Fri Sep  4 18:57:49 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Added docs for some user variables, and document
	them a bit better.  Very tentative format.  In particular, it'd be
	better if doc strings worked on variables (are they supposed to?)

Fri Sep  4 18:54:56 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* tests/constraint-stacking.scm, test/fvwm2-modules.scm: Added

Fri Sep  4 11:52:12 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm (window-viewport-position):  Check for sticky windows
	and handle them correctly.

Fri Sep  4 08:44:31 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Make display-area a variable, and use display-width,
	display-height

	* fvwm-module.scm: Added debug-fvwm-module var, turn on
	non-blocking, make more public function for debugging.

	* fvwm-eval.scm: Use move-window-viewport-position synonym instead
	of move-to. Use display-width, display-height vars

	* fvwm-compat.scm: Use display-width, display-height vars

	* doc.scm: put doc-files in the root module

	* bincomm.scm: binary-write was using default port of
	current-input-port, not current-output-port. fixed.

	* base.scm: Define vars display-width, display-height and use
	them.

1998-09-03  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* tests/test.scm (test-case): Add TITLE argument.

	* tests/properties.scm: Use it.
	Test `X-property-set!' with NAME != TYPE.

Thu Sep  3 15:21:17 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Fix docs of move-to -- it uses a viewport position;
	added move-window-viewport-position as a synonym for move-to

	* fvwm-eval.scm: Reindent.

Wed Sep  2 17:15:37 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm (flash-window): Make it restore the background color
	properly, and make it also set the highlight background color
	(uses the new primitives get-window-colors,
	get-highlight-window-colors, and set-window-highlight-background!

Wed Sep  2 13:31:50 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Do not assume a color is a string -- check first when
	redefining set-menu-{foreground,background}!

	* winops.scm: Added `resize-window' as a synonym for `resize-to'
	as the latter may soon be deprecated.

Wed Sep  2 11:56:36 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Put opaque-{resize,move}-percent in the root module
	by define-ing before the define-module (same hack as in base.scm)

	* prefs-menu.scm: Check scwm-is-constraint-enabled? for
	opaque-move menu -- use opaque-{move,resize}-percent variable

	* base.scm: Added `scwm-is-constraint-enabled?'

Wed Sep  2 10:57:00 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Added `X-cut-buffer-string'

Wed Sep  2 09:58:52 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Use window-viewport-position in
	popup-menu-from-decoration choosing where to put the menu on screen.

Tue Sep  1 16:31:25 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Added move-to, since move-window is the primitive that
	move-to used to be.  move-to moves a window to a viewport
	position, move-window (the primitive) moves a window to a virtual position

	* winops.scm: Updated docs for animated-move-to.

1998-09-01  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* tests/test.scm: New file containing testing facilities.

	* tests/properties.scm: Use them.

1998-08-31  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* flux.scm, wininfo.scm: Scheme sources adapted to new X property
	interface.

	* tests/properties.scm, tests/window-opns.scm: Removed tests for
	old X property interface, added some for the new one.

Tue Aug 25 14:37:43 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* optargs.scm: Preserve docstrings for precedures defined by
 	lambda* (and therefor define* and define*-public).

Fri Aug 21 15:59:15 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ALL: Added RCS-Id as first line, canonicalize copyrights (add
	1998, me where appropriate)

	* flux.scm, face.scm, bincomm.scm, base.scm, auto-raise.scm: Added
 	some documentation, changed formal param "w" to "win" as useful.

Fri Aug 14 19:24:34 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* wininfo.scm, wmconfig-menu.scm: Document a proc in each.

Fri Aug 14 17:13:35 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Added vars `opaque-move-percent' and
	  `opaque-resize-percent', procs `window-frame-area' and
	  `display-area', user-procs `resize-opaquely?' and
	  `move-opaquely?', and procs `interactive-move-maybe-opaque',
	  `interactive-resize-maybe-opaque', `move-or-raise-maybe-opaque',
	  `resize-or-raise-maybe-opaque'.  Document toggle-maximize.

	* std-menus.scm, prefs-menu.scm: Use new form of run-in-xterm w/
	  key arg xterm-options

	* flux.scm: use-module winops, and use
	  interactive-{move,resize}-maybe-opaque when doing
	  interactive-{move,resize}s

	* base.scm: Drop xterm-command to just "xterm", and make
	  run-in-xterm now take #:xterm-options STRING to give options to
	  the xterm program.  It is assummed that "-e" is used as the
	  argument to invoke the CMD.  Also added `scwm-user-var' macro as
	  a means at dynamically looking up a variable in
	  `the-root-module'.  This may not be the right way to do this--
	  feedback is appreciated.

Thu Aug 13 16:20:43 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* minimal.scm: Document all functions.

Thu Aug 13 16:04:20 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Document all public functions.  The define*-public
	  docstrings aren't accessible, though, and the emacs interface
	  seems to not permit %x as a procedure name.  Also changed
	  run-in-xterm to have the -e option already, and fixed std-menus
	  and prefs-menu for that convention.

	* prefs-menu.scm, std-menus.scm: Above mentioned fix to uses of
	  run-in-xterm.

Thu Aug 13 11:19:40 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* wininfo.scm: Fix percent visible to use window-frame-size, not
	  window-size

Wed Aug 12 17:21:31 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm, flux.scm: move "animated-move-to" into here (from
	  flux), and use (app scwm base) module

	* wininfo.scm: Added intersection-area and percent-visible from
	  Todd Larson, and use them in rectangle-overlap?

Wed Aug 12 15:31:33 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Use resize-frame-to and window-frame-size for
	  maxmize function

	* wininfo.scm: Use window-frame-size, except for
	  window-geometry-string which now uses the size in resize-inc
	  units

	* flux.scm, base.scm: Use window-frame-size for w%x, w%y, etc.

Fri Aug  7 17:57:49 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* stacking.scm: Add this new module with list-windows-above,
 	list-windows-below, raise-window-above (corrected from previous
 	version), lower-window-below, lower-by-one and raise-by-one.

	* winops.scm: Remove raise-window-above and lower-window-below
 	from here.

	* winlist.scm: Add #:by-stacking keyword arg to list-windows, and
 	show-window-list-menu.

	Also, since `pick' reverses the result, reverse it again.

	* wininfo.scm: Add windows-overlap? procedure to determine if two
 	windows overlap. Add window-overlaps-window? wrapper for this
 	which basically Currys it.


1998-08-07  Robert Bihlmeyer  <e9426626@stud2.tuwien.ac.at>

	* style.scm: First shot at making squashed-titlebar available as
	  a style option. s-t rocks.

Thu Aug  6 19:26:36 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* wininfo.scm: Fix from Todd Larason <jtl@molehill.org> to use the
	  display-size coordinates minus 1 as args to rectangle-overlap?

Wed Aug  5 20:13:15 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* wininfo.scm: Fix wildcard->regexp to turn ? into ., instead of
	  into .?; rename window-machine-name to window-client-machine-name

	* minimal.scm: Fixes to resize-or-raise and move-or-raise by
	  Stephen Tell.  Do not raise unless it's not a move or resize
	  event.

	* flux.scm: Added get-wm-command,
	  make-string-usable-for-resource-key, and S.Senda's make-rhosts-menu.

Sun Aug  2 16:31:41 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Added lower-window-below, raise-window-above as
	  front-ends to restack-windows.

	* wininfo.scm: added MSFIX: re: wildcard converter.  Added
	  window-machine-name (ideally this could get exposed to an
	  improved wildcard-matcher that distinguishes among Class,
	  Resource, Title, Icon-name, Window-machine-name, etc).

	* flux.scm: Added printable-char->keysym-string and use it to make
	  X-synthetic-send-string work with embedded spaces, newlines,
	  etc.  It's a very primitive keyboard macro facility, now.  Added
	  color->string as an accessor to the name property of a color
	  color->object.

	* doc.scm: Need to use (app scwm flux) for write-all

1998-08-01  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny3-12.ix.netcom.com>

	* fvwm-module.scm (send-mini-icon-packet): Use cdr-assq, not assq
	(and define it above). This should fix Greg's recently reported
	bug w/ mini-icons.

1998-08-01  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny4-24.ix.netcom.com>

	* fvwm-eval.scm ("ClickTime"): Replace set-click-time! with
	set-click-delay!

1998-07-31  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny5-12.ix.netcom.com>

	* base.scm, face.scm, fvwm-eval.scm, minimal.scm: Replace
	set-window-font! with set-title-font!

1998-07-31  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny3-12.ix.netcom.com>

	* base.scm (set-edge-resistance!, set-edge-scroll!,
	set-edge-wrap!): Added these convenience wrappers, but people
	should migrate to the new versions.

1998-07-30  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny3-12.ix.netcom.com>

	* decor.scm (#:use-decor): Deal with reversing the arguments to
	set-window-decor! for this style option.

	* fvwm-eval.scm: Major improvements from Danius Michaelides
	<danius@duff.org>; many more fvwm commands are now supported. See
	the end of the file for the complete support status.

Thu Jul 30 20:21:18 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Added select-multiple-windows-interactively (plus
	example with restack-windows), and select-window-from-window-list
	(plus example)

	* prefs-menu.scm: Cleanup a bit for lack of set-opaque-move-size!
	-- no real attempt to make the new parameter functional, though

Wed Jul 29 19:20:46 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* doc.scm: Added

	* flux.scm: Move doc-files and documentation into doc.scm; Added
	  find-window-by-name and window-bottom from Harvey Stein.

Mon Jul 27 20:07:17 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: use opaque moves by default, for
	  interactive-move-window-with-pointer, etc.

	* Added opaque-interactive-move, opaque-interactive-resize;
	improve messages on warning callbacks

1998-07-24  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Use string-append, duh.

1998-07-23  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Added new doc-files variable setting to use the new
	(scwm-path-prefix) primitive.  (For the new `documentation'
	procedure which accesses scwm-procedures.txt)

1998-07-23  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny1-20.ix.netcom.com>

	* fvwm-module.scm (add-window): Determine the icon file
	correctly. Thanks to Danius Michalides for the bug report.

1998-07-21  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny4-02.ix.netcom.com>

	* fvwm-module.scm: New interface to launching fvwm2 modules. This
	should be a better base for fvwm2 emulation, as well as a more
	convenient interface for users. Added/renamed/modified:

	variable: fvwm2-module-path

	register-fvwm2-module-config MODULE-TYPE . ARGS

	append-fvwm2-module-config MODULE-TYPE . ARGS
	clear-fvwm2-module-config MODULE-TYPE
	get-fvwm2-module-config MODULE-TYPE
	run-fvwm2-module MODULE-NAME #&optional OTHER-ARGS CONFIG-INFO
	  CONFIG-FILE
	kill-fvwm2-module FMOD
	kill-all-fvwm2-modules
	kill-fvwm2-modules-by-name MODULE-NAME

	See the comment at the top of the file for more details.

Tue Jul 21 14:31:08 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* tests/constraints.scm: Added sample of how to write constriants
	using embedded cassowary constraint solver. Constraints are now
	available at the scheme in nearly their full generality.

1998-07-20  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny5-21.ix.netcom.com>

	* fvwm-module.scm: Ignore SIGPIPE if using fvwm modules; they have
	a tendency to break the pipe when you kill them w/o sending KillMe
	(at least for me) for some reason.

	* base.scm (color-property): Added color-property
	procedure. Reversed order of key and object on image-property and
	font-property to be consistent and Schemey.

1998-07-20  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@localhost.localdomain>

	* fvwm-eval.scm ("WarpToWindow"): Make the fvwm2 "WarpToWindow"
	command pick a window to warp to if none specified. Kind of
	stupid, but complete.

	* fvwm-module.scm: Support the broadcast-mini-icon-hook. Also,
	make send-window-list send the complete list of information, just
	like fvwm2 sends it. Many things were missing before.

	* fvwm-module.scm (run-fvwm-module): Make sure to do something
	more sensible when reciving a packet that specifies no
	window. Patch from Danius Michaelides <danius@duff.org>

	* fvwm-eval.scm: Handle the case where no window is specified more
	gracefully. Add support for Exec, Restart, Quit, Resize, Lower,
	and WarpToWindow fvwm commands. Add support for a special Eval
	command; this lets Fvwm modules evaluate arbitrary Scheme
	expressions, allowing for FvwmButtons configs for instance, to be
	very flexible. Patch from Danius Michaelides <danius@duff.org>

1998-07-15  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny2-12.ix.netcom.com>

	* style.scm: Added #:placement-proc and #:transient-placement-proc
	style options, to allow setting user-defined placement
	procedures. See C code directory ChangeLog for rationale on
	splitting these, and what procedures may be used from within a
	placement proc.

Mon Jul  6 01:51:30 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* auto-raise.scm: Replaced window-from-window-id with id->window.

	* fvwm-module.scm: Removed now useless definition of id->window.

1998-07-06  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* prefs-menu.scm: Added animation-ms-delay define, since it must
	be known before the prefs-menu definition.

	* flux.scm: add an extra menu-separator after menu-title, to make
	look more like the prefs-menu and xlock-menu

1998-07-04  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* std-menus.scm: Use xlock-query-program to decide what to run to
	query the modes for the screensaver

	* base.scm: comment out the remove-hook! macro, since there is
	also code that defines the macro iff it's not already defined;
	add reset-hook! macro
	set invalid-interaction-hook and cannot-grab-hook to ring the bell
	with (beep)

1998-06-26  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny1-21.ix.netcom.com>

	* fvwm-module.scm(run-fvwm-module): Add a few sanity checks to
	make sure running a nonexistent module won't break things.

1998-06-23  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny1-07.ix.netcom.com>

	* std-menus.scm: Use the (ice-9 regex) module.

1998-06-20  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@localhost.localdomain>

	* fvwm-module.scm: Use the new input hook system (add-input-hook!
	and remove-input-hook!, instead of using add-input-hook and
	counting on the hook being a one-shot).

Wed Jun 10 02:19:58 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* auto-raise.scm, flux.scm: minor typos fixed, thanks to Shuji
 	Narazaki <narazaki@dai.comp.kyutech.ac.jp> for the bug report and
 	patch.

Mon Jun  1 20:34:30 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: regenerated with automake 1.3

Thu Apr  2 18:08:09 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* minimal.scm: Set the rubber band mask to something better so the
 	rubber band actually shows up on 16bpp and higher systems by
 	default. Bug report from Francesco Tapparo
 	<f.tapparo@vi.nettuno.it>.

Mon Mar 30 15:38:00 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* auto-raise.scm: New auto-raise module. The #:auto-raise,
 	#:auto-raise-delay, #:auto-raise-focus-proc,
 	#:auto-raise-unfocus-proc and #:auto-raise-unfocus-delay window
 	style options added by this module control auto-raise. Still not
 	as general as I'd like (it should be possible to set an arbitrary
 	number of independent focus-unfocus pairs so you could do typical
 	autoraise and the maximize-unmaximize hack independently with
 	different timeouts), but will e eventually. See the file for
 	exaple usage.

	Makefile.in: Install auto-raise.scm

Sun Mar 29 18:19:57 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* fvwm-module.scm: Define and export kill-all-fvwm-modules which
 	kills all active fvwm modules; add it to the shutdown hook.

	* style.scm: Use new-style new-window hooks.

	* minimal.scm: Remove reliance on old-style new-window hooks;
 	they're not really needed anymore anyway, AddWindow should set
 	default colors of some sort.

Sun Mar 29 10:47:24 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Add transient? to window-info

	* fvwm-eval.scm: Fix typo that showed up with FvwmWinList

Sun Mar 29 15:04:31 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* base.scm: Add thunk macro.

	* base.scm: Only define remove-hook! if not already defined by
 	Guile.

Fri Mar 27 19:25:19 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* fvwm-module.scm: Use the new interface for broadcast hooks.

	* base.scm: Added remove-hook! to complement guile's add-hook!.

Thu Mar 26 11:32:29 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* fvwm-module.scm: Send more information to the module in
 	send-window-list (still not quite all that fvwm sends). Also a few
 	minor bug fixes. FvwmWinList now works.

	* fvwm-eval.scm: Added support for "Focus" and "Iconify" fvwm
 	builtins, reportedly needed by TkDesk.

Wed Mar 25 14:38:03 1998  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: use-module (ice-9 regex)

	* prefs-menu.scm: define-module misnamed the module -- removed
	trailing `s' from the name so prefs-menu matches the file name.
	Also added a comment about ask-string and how it might work...

Tue Mar 24 16:43:32 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.in (install): install flux.scm

Tue Mar 24 16:09:00 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* fvwm-compat.scm: Added all the FvwmM4 simple macros like
 	X_RESOLUTION, and CLASS

	* flux.scm: added sleep-ms and X-synthetic-send-string

Tue Mar 24 14:15:16 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* fvwm-module.scm: Append newlines to the configuration strings;
 	this is needed to make the pager happy with geometry
 	specifications and maybe other things. Bug report and patch from
 	Bucky LaDieu <nega@vt.edu>.

Mon Mar 23 15:47:45 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Added flux.scm: Pulled out a bunch of
	functions from gjb.scwmrc (many originally from sds.scwmrc) and
	put here so we could share them better as we decide how to
	migrate the functionality into standard functionality (or do
	something different).

Wed Mar 11 21:05:11 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* fvwm-compat.scm, bincomm.scm, fvwm-module.scm: Use close-port
 	instead of close for guile 1.2 compatablility. Bug report from
 	Bucky LaDieu <nega@vt.edu>.

Tue Mar 10 22:39:58 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* fvwm-compat.scm: Added a bunch of commented out functions for
 	FvwmM4 pre-defines; these need to be fleshed out, but I wanted to
 	get the code started so I could see/think about what new
 	primitives we'll need to support the defines.

Fri Mar  6 02:50:47 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* fvwm-module.scm: Slight corrections to the extra argument stuff;
 	also, broadcast the page info to modules that request the window
 	list.

	* base.scm: A few changes to make menu-style work right.

	* fvwm-module.scm: Added optional other-args argument to module.

Thu Mar  5 00:33:50 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* fvwm-eval.scm: Added support for the KillMe fvwm module command,
 	so modules can kill themselves.

1998-03-04  Jens-Ulrik Petersen  <petersen@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp>

	* winlist.scm (circulate): Improved its behaviour when there is no
	window with focus.

Mon Mar  2 23:49:19 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* std-menus.scm, wmconfig-menu.scm: minor fixes from Sam Steingold
 	<sds@usa.net>

Sun Mar  1 02:21:15 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Install the new modules.

	* fvwm-module.scm: A new module that allows fvwm2 modules to be
 	run from within scwm. The relevant procedures are run-fvwm-module
 	and kill-fvwm-module.

	* fvwm-eval.scm: A new module to support evaluating fvwm2rc
 	lanugage expressions. The primary use is for the fvwm module
 	support code. The principal export is fvwm-eval which takes a
 	string expression and optionally a module (as returned by
 	run-fvwm-module) and a window.

	* bincomm.scm: A new module for binary communication; it's
 	intended to be used by the fvwm module code, but code to support
 	other legacy module protocols may want to use it as well. It may
 	be helpful to rewrite this in C someday.

Sat Feb 28 01:34:28 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* image-loaders.scm: A new file that supports loading images in
 	foreig formats through several converters. Slower than native
 	loading, but better than nothing. Exported procedures are
 	ImageMagick-loader and netpbm-loader, which try to use their
 	namesake packages to convert the image to xpm and then try to load
 	it, try-everything-loader which tries both in order and will
 	support any other available conversion methods in the future, and
 	support-image-conversion, a simple wrapper which establishes
 	try-everything-loader as the default loader.

	Makefile.in: Install image-loaders.scm.

	* Makefile.in: Install wmconfig-menu.scm, std-menus.scm

	* base.scm: Added run-in-xterm from Sam Steingold <sds@usa.net>

	* std-menus.scm: Renamed the former xlock-menu.scm to this and
 	added make-hosts-menu, a useful menu for a set of hosts to telnet
 	to.

	* wmconfig-menu.scm: Added documentation and miscellaneous fixes
 	from Sam Steingold <sds@usa.net>.

Wed Feb 25 21:39:58 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* wmconfig-menu.scm: New module contributed by Sam Steingold
 	<sds@usa.net> - this provides the function make-wmconfig-menu,
 	which parses the Red Hat 5.0 /etc/X11/wmconfig directory and
 	returns a mennu which reflects its contents. The title and name of
 	the menu, and the directory to scan, may optionally be specified
 	in that order. Appropriate defaults are provided.

	* xlock-menu.scm: New module contributed by Sam Steingold - the
 	key exciting bit is the make-xlock-menu function which creates a
 	menu with several xlock screensaver choices. The optional argument
 	specifies wether or not to lock the screen when launching
 	screensavers; the default is #f.

	* base.scm: Added fold-menu-list and exe, contributed by Sam
 	Steingold.

	fold-menu-list takes a menu and an optional number of lines, and
 	splits it at that number of lines (or 30 by default), adding
 	"more..."-labeled submenu entries. exe is just a wrapper around
 	execute that returns a procedure which will run the specified
 	command.

	* minimal.scm: Changed load-font reference to make-font

	* base.scm: Changed references to load-font to use make-font
 	instead; defined load-font as make-font for compatability;
 	font-property function for getting single properties of a font.

Fri Feb 20 04:42:04 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* base.scm: Added image-property convenience wrapper to get at
 	individual image properties.

	* style.scm: Added #:show-icon and #:force-icon options, removed
 	some crufty old comments.

Fri Dec 12 16:15:28 1997  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Permit a string action in a menuitem to mean (execute
 	string), permit string color-bg and color-text in a menu, use
 	'menu-text-color, 'menu-bg-color, and 'menu-font as the defaults
 	so they can be redefined later -- note that the user must still
 	define these variables in their .scwmrc before building menus or
 	else the quoted symbol doesn't work (symbol table scope issue due
	to modules?)

Sun Nov 30 11:56:30 1997  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Use new menuing interface: menu-title and
 	menu-separator are new variables, (menu ..) and (menuitem ..) are
 	new public definitions

	* minimal.scm: Use new primitive menu interface -- make-menu and
 	make-menuitem.

	* winlist.scm: Make show-window-list-menu use new menuing
 	interface

Mon Nov 10 05:43:11 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* fvwm-compat.scm: In fvwm-pipe-read, use dup to properly connect
 	the pipe to the standard output for the subprocess.

	* style.scm: Use make-image in lieu of make-picture.

Mon Nov 10 00:16:04 1997  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: added toggle-window-shade-animated

Sun Nov  9 16:45:50 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* base.scm: Added a new more abstract syntax for menu items to
 	allow more flexibility in changing the menu implementation;
 	procedures menu-title, menu-separator and menu-item should be used
 	to specify menu items instead of explicitly passing symbols or
 	lists.

	* style.scm: stop using set-icon-maybe-name! and
 	set-mini-icon-maybe-name! and comment them out; would rather have
 	string handling in the primitvs for now.

Sat Nov  8 20:35:26 1997  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* style.scm: allow pixmaps or strings in window styles

Fri Nov  7 03:26:00 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* base.scm: Renamed title-style to simple-title-style; the real
 	title-style is now in face.scm.

	* face.scm: New file face.scm which implements a friendlier
 	interface to title, button and border styles than the primitve
 	interface. The exported procedures are title-style, border-style
 	and button-style; they are somewhat analogous to the fvwm builtins
 	with similar names.

Mon Nov  3 01:12:41 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* decor.scm: Add the #:use-decor style option.

1997-10-31  Jens-Ulrik Holger Petersen  <petersen@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp>

	* winlist.scm (#:winlist-skip): add-boolean-style-option

1997-10-24  Jens-Ulrik Holger Petersen  <petersen@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp>

	* Makefile.in (mostlyclean): New target.

	* wininfo.scm (window-geometry-string): Format geometry output
	in standard way.

	* winlist.scm (winlist-skip?): Fixed; was constant #f.

Thu Oct 23 20:03:30 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* decor.scm: Added some basic support for decors: the
 	call-with-decor procedure and with-decor macro.

	* style.scm, style-options.scm, winlist.scm, winops.scm: Split
 	style.scm into styles.scm which provides the various style
 	commands and style-options.scm which provides the tables of style
 	options and hooks to add new ones. style.scm now does not need to
 	use every module that may define procedures that should be
 	available as style options; the files can just use the (app scwm
 	style-options) module and define relevant options themselves. This
 	was done for #:circulate-skip, #:circulate-skip-icon,
 	#:winlist-skip, and #:start-maximized.

Tue Oct 21 21:04:31 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* style.scm: Change #:mwm-buttons from a style option to a hint
 	option.

Mon Oct 20 06:10:38 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* winlist.scm: Circulate (and therefore prev-window and
 	next-window) were giving an error when no window in the window
 	list satisfied the given conditions.  This is now fixed. Bug
 	reported by Jens-Ulrik Holger Petersen
 	<petersen@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp>.

	* wininfo.scm: in-viewport-any-desk? and visible? were not working
 	correctly when the viewport is away from 0,0; this is fixed. Bug
 	reported by Jens-Ulrik Holger Petersen
 	<petersen@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp>.

Sun Oct 19 01:33:50 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Use mkinstalldirs to create the scwm scheme
 	directory if necessary.

Sat Oct 18 02:19:58 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* wininfo.scm: wildcard-matcher: reversed the order of the if and
 	then clauses in (if full-regexp ...). Patch from Mikael
 	Djurfeldt <mdj@nada.kth.se>

Fri Oct 17 18:18:55 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* style.scm: The 'new-window and 'new-window-hint event handlers
 	were changes to call the old handler first and then execute the
 	style hooks.

	Also, the #:lenience style option was added.

	* base.scm: Fixed a bug in move-viewport - the let syntax was
 	incorrect. Bug report and fix from Holger Petersen
 	<petersen@kurmis.kyotou.ac.jp>

	* Makefile.in: Added VPATH support.
