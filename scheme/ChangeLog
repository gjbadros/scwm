Sun Nov 30 11:56:30 1997  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Use new menuing interface: menu-title and
 	menu-separator are new variables, (menu ..) and (menuitem ..) are
 	new public definitions

	* minimal.scm: Use new primitive menu interface -- make-menu and
 	make-menuitem.

	* winlist.scm: Make show-window-list-menu use new menuing
 	interface

Mon Nov 10 05:43:11 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* fvwm-compat.scm: In fvwm-pipe-read, use dup to properly connect
 	the pipe to the standard output for the subprocess.
	
	* style.scm: Use make-image in lieu of make-picture.

Mon Nov 10 00:16:04 1997  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: added toggle-window-shade-animated

Sun Nov  9 16:45:50 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* base.scm: Added a new more abstract syntax for menu items to
 	allow more flexibility in changing the menu implementation;
 	procedures menu-title, menu-separator and menu-item should be used
 	to specify menu items instead of explicitly passing symbols or
 	lists.

	* style.scm: stop using set-icon-maybe-name! and
 	set-mini-icon-maybe-name! and comment them out; would rather have
 	string handling in the primitvs for now.

Sat Nov  8 20:35:26 1997  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* style.scm: allow pixmaps or strings in window styles

Fri Nov  7 03:26:00 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* base.scm: Renamed title-style to simple-title-style; the real
 	title-style is now in face.scm.

	* face.scm: New file face.scm which implements a friendlier
 	interface to title, button and border styles than the primitve
 	interface. The exported procedures are title-style, border-style
 	and button-style; they are somewhat analogous to the fvwm builtins
 	with similar names.

Mon Nov  3 01:12:41 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* decor.scm: Add the #:use-decor style option.

1997-10-31  Jens-Ulrik Holger Petersen  <petersen@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp>

	* winlist.scm (#:winlist-skip): add-boolean-style-option

1997-10-24  Jens-Ulrik Holger Petersen  <petersen@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp>

	* Makefile.in (mostlyclean): New target.

	* wininfo.scm (window-geometry-string): Format geometry output
	in standard way.

	* winlist.scm (winlist-skip?): Fixed; was constant #f.

Thu Oct 23 20:03:30 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* decor.scm: Added some basic support for decors: the
 	call-with-decor procedure and with-decor macro.

	* style.scm, style-options.scm, winlist.scm, winops.scm: Split
 	style.scm into styles.scm which provides the various style
 	commands and style-options.scm which provides the tables of style
 	options and hooks to add new ones. style.scm now does not need to
 	use every module that may define procedures that should be
 	available as style options; the files can just use the (app scwm
 	style-options) module and define relevant options themselves. This
 	was done for #:circulate-skip, #:circulate-skip-icon,
 	#:winlist-skip, and #:start-maximized.

Tue Oct 21 21:04:31 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* style.scm: Change #:mwm-buttons from a style option to a hint
 	option.

Mon Oct 20 06:10:38 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* winlist.scm: Circulate (and therefore prev-window and
 	next-window) were giving an error when no window in the window
 	list satisfied the given conditions.  This is now fixed. Bug
 	reported by Jens-Ulrik Holger Petersen
 	<petersen@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp>.

	* wininfo.scm: in-viewport-any-desk? and visible? were not working
 	correctly when the viewport is away from 0,0; this is fixed. Bug
 	reported by Jens-Ulrik Holger Petersen
 	<petersen@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp>.

Sun Oct 19 01:33:50 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Use mkinstalldirs to create the scwm scheme
 	directory if necessary.

Sat Oct 18 02:19:58 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* wininfo.scm: wildcard-matcher: reversed the order of the if and
 	then clauses in (if full-regexp ...). Patch from Mikael
 	Djurfeldt <mdj@nada.kth.se>

Fri Oct 17 18:18:55 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* style.scm: The 'new-window and 'new-window-hint event handlers
 	were changes to call the old handler first and then execute the
 	style hooks.
	
	Also, the #:lenience style option was added.

	* base.scm: Fixed a bug in move-viewport - the let syntax was
 	incorrect. Bug report and fix from Holger Petersen
 	<petersen@kurmis.kyotou.ac.jp>

	* Makefile.in: Added VPATH support.
