	* flash-window.scm, winops.scm: Make a bunch of procs interactive
 	that weren't before.

Sat Dec  4 21:40:46 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Fixed dirvector->string -- was
	testing for 1 in vector positions, instead of just #t or #f.
	Fixed incorrect call to do get-window-with-nonant-interactively
	properly for anchor constraint.

	* ui-constraints-composition.scm: Do not create a new window class 
	if the composition is recorded with an empty name -- treat that as 
	aborting the record (though the constraints added during the
	record will still remain;  that behaviour maybe should change)

Sat Dec  4 21:15:05 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Update the tooltip help to be laid
	out a little bit narrower (just by adding blanks to end of first

	* ui-constraints-toggle-menu.scm: Drop the composition menu items
	now that they are in the toolbar.

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Added
	`two-window-or-more-nonant-prompter' that uses
	get-window-nonant-interactively and use it for ui-cnctr-align and
	ui-cnctr-strict-relpos.  Fix `valign-nonant->string' to report
	"left" "center" or "right" instead of top/middle/bottom.

	* ui-constraints-buttons.scm: Make animation happen only when
	inside the toolbar.

	* highlight-current-window.scm: Needed to use window-selection module.

	* ui-constraints-composition.scm: Use `add-hook-once!', use no
	pixmaps for the composition additions.

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Updated for extra field in
	ui-constraint-class objects.  Use second pixmap for two of the
	buttons.  Still need to provide a right-click menu for stopping

	them when both pixmap-name and pixmap2-name fields are set.  Added

	* debianapps-menu.scm: New version from Francesco w/ some light
 	modifications by me.  He: cleaned up code; made
 	make-debianapps-menu pass args through to menu to permit, e.g., a
 	side-image.  Added *debian-menu-path* option: Perhaps a file list
 	would be better here > (something as '("/etc/X11/scwm/scwm_menus"
 	"/home/cesco/personal_menus")), > but I do'nt know if I can use
 	the #:path type in this case; borrowed some code from Greg's
 	system.scwmrc to make the generated menu > more good looking. I
 	kept out some menu entries because they call proprietary >
 	programs (Netscape): this is not very good for a debian package

Thu Dec  2 09:26:25 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am (scwm_common_scheme): Added cursor.scm

	constraints.scm, ui-constraints-toggle-menu.scm: Added use-module
	of (cassowary constraints).  I'm not sure how the primitives from

	* Makefile.am: Added corba.scm and viavoice-smrc.scm (make check
	reported them as missing)

Wed Oct  6 15:27:28 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-gtk-toggle-menu.scm: Use spacing of 1 between
	constraint instances.  Use two-column table, with second column
	hboxes containing enable checkboxes AND the delete buttons.  Give
	that box right alignment so things line up better.  Give the whole 
	ui some spacing, move the three standard buttons into a single
	hbuttonbox at the button of the UI.  Much improved look!

Mon Oct  4 22:50:47 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm (one-window-prompter): Return just the
 	window, not a list of a single window.  This was causing problems
	for the min/max height/width buttons when pre-selecting.

	* style.scm: Go back to border-width being a hint.  I can't get
	everything to work with it as a hint right now.

	* netscape.scm (netscape-google-search-cut-buffer): Noop if no
	cut-buffer string.

Mon Oct  4 17:20:55 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	coordinates before calling the animation functions that take
	virtual, not viewport coordinates.

	* base.scm: Let vpx->vx, vpy->vy, vx->vpx, vy->vpy pass a #f
	through w/o error.

Mon Oct  4 14:12:49 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* style.scm: Make border-width a hint so that it takes effect
	earlier.  Thanks to E. Jay Berkenbilt for bug report!

	* minimal.scm: Turn off buffering of output port for recent guile
 	versions that need it (this so that the system.scwmrc doesn't need
 	to do it itself).

Sun Oct  3 15:44:01 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* viavoice.scm, ui-constraints.scm, register.scm,
 	property-respond.scm, fvwm-module.scm, fvwm-eval.scm, flux.scm,
	dir-focus.scm, constraints.scm, animation.scm:
 	Use new names window-with-pointer, window-with-focus

	copy-window-title-to-cut-buffer;
	paste-window-title-from-cut-buffer0 to
	paste-window-title-from-cut-buffer.

	* window-configuration.scm: Added `push-window-configuration',
	`pop-window-configuration', `window-configuration-menu'. And
	define `window-configuration-menu' to expose this functionality.

	* wavplay.scm: Do not try to play a sound that couldn't be found.

	* flux.scm: Added shortcut keys for the window-ops menu.  Added
	Configuration submenu.  Added `config-request-animate' to do
	animated configure requests.

Fri Oct  1 21:54:59 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* constraints.scm: Do not use bind-four-modifier-key-events here.
	Leave keybindings to .scwmrc.

Fri Oct  1 17:08:15 1999    <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* wavplay.scm: Use defined? not scwm-module-loaded? to see if
	esound was loaded okay.

1999-10-01  E. Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* xprop-extras.scm (X-cut-buffer-string): changed to use
	X-fetch-bytes, just added to miscprocs.c.

	resource menus.

	* last-mapped-window.scm: Added.  Thanks to Craig Kaplan for idea!

Wed Sep 29 23:09:12 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* gnome-hints.scm: Added some commented out debugging.  Do not set 
	a window to be maximized when it is also set to be minimized (gmc
	desktop_icons are this way, and maximizing them was causing them
	to lose their y positioin -- all went to (0,0) in error).

Wed Sep 29 17:54:17 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window-configuration.scm: Use atomic resize-fram with positions
	in `copy-window-configuration' (and use animated version for now-- 
	optional later).  Thanks E. Jay Berkenbilt for noticing the
	problem and suggesting a correct fix.

	* minimal.scm: Added `append-hook!' which might make more sense to 
	use by default (more intuitive behaviour, though less efficient
	[small beans, though]).

Wed Sep 29 11:43:25 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Use animated-deiconify-to-vp-focus.

	* animated-iconify.scm: Added iconify-animation-offsets and use

	`animated-deiconify-to-current-viewport'.

Wed Sep 29 10:04:07 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* decor.scm: Make use-decor a window-hint option, not a
	window-style option, so changes in border sizes and titlebar
	heights affect initial positioning properly.  Thanks E. Jay
	Berkenbilt for the bug report!

Tue Sep 28 23:08:37 1999    <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Only define `print-window' if xpr program exists,
	use path-cache module.

	* winlist.scm: Propoagate the hover-delay and popup-delay items to 
	submenus for `make-window-list-menu'.

	* prompt-color.scm: Use prompting-shell.

	* listops.scm: ws change

	* flux.scm: Rename `menu-window-move' to `menu-window-shove', call 
	it "shove" not "move" in menus.  Fix window group menu from the
	root menu.

	* base.scm: (C) update.

Tue Sep 28 17:47:36 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

Tue Sep 28 14:57:35 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* preferences.scm: Switch *preferences-use-notebook* to default 
	to #f since the listbook format is nicer and the new guile-gtk has
	the bug that this was tweaking fixed.

Tue Sep 28 14:42:26 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* prompting-shell.scm, prompt-proc.scm, prompt-font.scm, 
	prompt-file.scm, prompt-color.scm, prompt-binding.scm, 
	preferences.scm, stylist.scm: Use "clicked" signal instead
 	of "pressed" signal on the various buttons

Tue Sep 28 13:16:23 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* register.scm: Fix type "Emacs"->"Scwm".

	* flux.scm: Move `add-left-button', `add-right-button' from
	system.scwmrc, added `reset-buttons!'

	* stylist.scm: Use hbutton-box for widgets along bottom, fix
	`run-hooks' to `run-hook'.  Add a menu-separator to the menu.  Now 
	this is functional again.

Mon Sep 27 15:19:41 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* undo.scm: Move bindings into system.scwmrc; they shouldn't be in 
	the module.

	`string-ci-has-prefix';  move `remove-suffix' here from flux.

	* reflection.scm: Added `procedure-string->procedure'

	* prompt-proc.scm: Move gtk-clist-get-row-values to front.  Use
	procedure-string->procedure.  Put widgets in a frame and use some
	more reasonable spacing (inspired by prompt-binding.scm).

	* prompt-binding.scm: Hook the things together.  Now its a really
	nice browsing interface, but doesn't yet let you change anything.

	* flux.scm: Added `proc-doc' that caches the documentation as it
	reads it from file, if necessary.

Sat Sep 25 13:11:13 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* prompt-binding.scm: Make insert/delete buttons insensitive until 
	they do something useful.  Do signal connections at the end after
	all widgets are defined.  Sort the commands and the bindings.

Sat Sep 25 12:32:53 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* reflection.scm, flux.scm: Move procedure->string to reflection,
 	from flux.

	* prompt-proc.scm: Some cleanup.

	* prompt-binding.scm: Added

	* gtk.scm: Let `image->gtk-pixmap' handle string pseudo-images,
	too, so it is a little more flexible.

	* gtk-menu.scm: Define `scwm-gtk-menu-title',
	`scwm-gtk-menu-separator', `menuitem->scwm-gtk-menuitem'.  Permits 
	scwm-gtk-menus to be created w/o using any of the standard Scwm
	menuing framework.

Fri Sep 24 11:39:09 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* gtk.scm: Added `image->gtk-pixmap'

	* gtk-menu.scm: Added `scwm-gtk-menuitem' to honour image-left
 	attribute of menuitems.  Now gtk-menus can have mini-icons.

Fri Sep 24 11:14:15 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Added menu-window-move, and include it in the small

 	timer-hooks.

	* gtk.scm: Reduce frequency of gratuitous gtk event handles from
	every 50ms to every 150ms.

	* time-convert.scm: Drop usec fns since timer-hooks now use msec.

	now, anyway.

1999-09-23  Jeff Nichols  <jwnichls@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Added nonant support to 
	strict-relative-position.  Now parts of windows can be kept relative
	to parts of other windows.

	* window-locations.scm: window-left-top was incorrectly returning a 
	list of x and y locations rather than (X . Y)

Thu Sep 23 15:44:58 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Use filter-map, not map, for
	make-menuitems-from-menu-information-list.

	* winlist.scm: Change `show-window-list-menu' to take warp-to-index 
	(not warp-to-first) and have permit-alt-release-selection as
	another argument.  Update uses.

	* flux.scm: Update uses of `show-window-list-menu', make
	window-task-switcher-menu go to the third item initially (the
	window that second-most-recently had the focus)

	* flux-gtk.scm: Update uses of `show-window-list-menu'

Thu Sep 23 00:09:56 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* netscape.scm: Added `cgi-escapify-space'; this (and
 	uri-escapify-comma) should be remove in favor of using some guile
 	module with this support.  Added google stuff from system.scwmrc.

	(list-ref X display-info 2) when setting PLANES.

	unmaximize (hopefully not incorrectly!) and make them honour new
	variable *maximize-animatedly*

	* std-menus.scm, rgb-database.scm, path-cache.scm, flux.scm,
	file.scm: use conditional use-modules, instead of expanding out
	define-module twice to pick whether or not the popen module is
	included based on guile-version.

	* flux.scm: Added `make-X-geometry', `float->integer'

Mon Sep 20 17:29:07 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* animated-iconify.scm: Use xlib-set-line-attributes!, not removed 
	xlib-set-line-width!

	xlib-set-line-attributes, and use symbolic 'on-off-dash for the
	rest where 1 was used before

 	the user to specify whether they would like disabled constraints
	displayed.

Sun Sep 19 20:15:21 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* nonants.scm: Put *nonant-highlight-color* in winops, not own group.

	* nonants.scm: Added `nonant-decoration',
	`highlight-window-nonant', `unhighlight-window-nonant', and make
	the mark-nonant-motion-handler use them instead of message
	windows.  We still need to use message-windows for persistent
	markers until I make something that lets a corner/side color
	change remain persistent (or make the C code aware of highlighting 
	noants).

	* ScwmBiff.scm: Replace incorrectly positioned define with a let
	binding instead.  Patch from Glenn Trigg. (Needed for >= guile-1.3.2).

	* flux.scm: Moved some stuff from system.scwmrc to here.  Make
	`{next,prev}-visible-non-iconified-window' use focussable-window?
	and also ignore shaded windows.

Sat Sep 18 14:02:09 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* viavoice.scm: Handles lots more commands, easier to change the
	grammar now w/o restarting.

	* preferences.scm: Quote symbols too, when outputting them to
	.scwm-options (not just lists).  Need this to fix "undefined symbol

	undraw-constraints-of-window functions.

	* Makefile.am: Added prompt-enum.scm

	* prompt-enum.scm: Added

	perfect because of window-style's behaviour that it overrides
	settings on all matched windows.

	* preferences.scm: Handle 'enum type

	* defoption.scm: Added prompt-from-symbol and #:name opotion for
	changing the prompt.

Wed Sep 15 13:47:07 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

Tue Sep 14 14:29:29 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* gnome-hints.scm: Add _WIN_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK property to the

	running.

Mon Sep 13 22:43:15 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* preferences.scm: Turn on *preferences-use-notebook* by default
	since the *preferences-use-notebook* == #f is buggy.

	* winops.scm, themes.scm, primopts.scm, message-window.scm,

	base.scm, auto-raise.scm: Added define-scwm-group call for
	preferences groups that are used.

	* preferences.scm: Added *preferences-use-notebook* and add a
	listbox-based preferences UI (that is still buggy -- causes a
	coredump in guile-gtk code).

	* defoption.scm: Added `define-scwm-group', related procs.

	* prompt-range.scm: Make the scale size automatically instead of
	fixing the size.

	* std-menus.scm: Comment out the *context-map* variable for now.

	* winops.scm: Move the *opaque-move-percent* and *resize-opaquely-proc* into
	group 'winops, not 'window-movement

	* std-menus.scm, flux.scm, file.scm, rgb-database.scm,
	path-cache.scm: Use guile-version, not (minor-version) for testing 
	guile versions.

Mon Sep 13 11:48:11 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* minimal.scm: Define guile-version variable to be, e.g., 1.33 so
	it's easier to use as a test.

Sun Sep 12 21:44:16 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am (scwm_common_scheme): Added reflection.scm.

1999-09-08 Jeffrey Nichols   <jwnichls@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Optional parameters for show-titlebar-in-place
	and hide-titlebar-in-place were missing some parens.

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Added the sum-to-width and 
	sum-to-height constraint classes.  

	* Makefile.am: added hooks.scm

Wed Sep  8 18:12:40 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Wrote `window-class', `window-resource' using
	WM_CLASS (they were primitives, now renamed to *-hint).

Tue Sep  7 16:39:05 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Added `use-placement-hint' for use especially with
	GNOME desktop gmc icons.

	* gnome-hints.scm: Added comment re gnome-hints file.

Tue Sep  7 15:50:57 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* themes.scm: Move remove-suffix into flux.scm, and use basename
	instead from here.  Fix initialization of *theme-path*.  Thanks
	Dirk Hermann.

	* flux.scm: Moved `remove-suffix' here from themes.scm since
	themes.scm no longer needs it

Mon Sep  6 23:01:36 1999    <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* test-case.scm: Return answer, not #<undefined>.

	* reflection.scm: Workaround (procedure-source current-module)
	bug.  Fix `procedure-required-formals' to not consider a rest args 
	to be a required argument (it kind of is, but can get bound to an
	empty list). Added `apropos-internal-with-modules',
	`procedure-is-interactive?', etc.

	* prompt-range.scm: Tweak some of the look.

	* prompt-proc.scm: Much, much improved version that operates as a
	primitive documentation browser, too.  Still could use lots of
	work, of course.

	* preferences.scm: Put ok, apply, cancel buttons all on the same
	row and make them look better.  No more stupid "Done and dismiss"
	button! 

	* constraints.scm: Make the solver variable public at the
	top-level so we can get at it.  (Changed because of a possible
	quirky behaviour--- might be wholly unnecessary, but could be
	useful anyway, so I'm keeping it).

	* minimal.scm, base.scm: Move hook compatibility stuff from
	base.scm into minimal.scm.

Mon Sep  6 19:59:24 1999    <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winlist.scm: Fix `show-window-list-menu' -- was completely
	broken since split into make-window-list-menu.

	* reflection.scm: Added `procedure-apropos'.

Mon Sep  6 17:56:34 1999    <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* doc.scm: Added `hook-documentation', `object-documentation'

	* base.scm: Added `hook?' since it's missing from Guile-1.3.[23]
	-- maybe will be in guile-1.3.4?

Mon Sep  6 17:17:37 1999    <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* test-case.scm: Display error message on failures so I can just
	load in a whole file -- optional via display-test-case-errors
	variable. 

	* reflection.scm: Improved significantly... works with primitives
	now, too, thanks to fancier scwm-snarf extraction process

	* optargs.scm: Re-instate reverted changes, and fix bug that
	caused me to revert them (was returning #<unspecified> from second 
	branch of lambda* macro.

	* face.scm: Use #&rest, not .;  the docs in optargs say that the
	. is okay, but it fails for me.
	

Mon Sep  6 12:28:46 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window-selection.scm, ui-constraints.scm, property-respond.scm:
	Use `define-scwm-hook'

	* defoption.scm: Fix documentation, unfold a gratuitous apply.

	* minimal.scm, ScwmButtons.scm: ws change

	* hooks.scm: Added `define-scwm-hook' to permit associating a
	docstring with scheme-level hooks.

Mon Sep  6 10:38:56 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* gnome-hints.scm: Use the bpress_win for the
	_WIN_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK so that the wm_properties_capplet can
	shutdown Scwm (it appears to do so by XKillClient-ing that window
	-- we were using the root window, before, which of course cannot
	be killed).

Sun Sep  5 20:28:25 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* optargs.scm: Revert back since my changes broke stuff.

Sun Sep  5 19:50:50 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* reflection.scm: Added docs to `procedure-formals', added
	`procedure-keyword-arguments', `procedure-optional-arguments'.

Sun Sep  5 19:34:00 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* optargs.scm: Added setting of 'optargs-arglist procedure
	property on lambda* (and cousin) procedure definitions.

	* reflection.scm: Added -- better support for interactive
	programming with Guile/Scwm.

Sun Sep  5 12:49:37 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* minimal.scm: Set _WIN_WM_NAME, _WIN_WM_VERSION properties on the 
	root window.

Sat Sep  4 01:09:24 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* prompt-proc.scm: Fixed a bad define placement using a let.

Sat Sep  4 00:22:10 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Added `half' to simplify integer division by 2.

	* gnome-hints.scm: Implement button-proxying support.  Added
	`gnome-desktop-press' and related procedures.  Use message-window
	to be the button-proxy window, and announce support for it.

	* placement.scm: Added `center-placement'

	* winlist.scm: Change `show-window-list-menu' to
	`make-window-list-menu' and add a `show-window-list-menu' on top
	of that.

Thu Sep  2 13:41:09 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window-selection.scm: Move nonant markers closer to edge.  Still
 	problems with accidentally selecting the markers -- big problem if
 	you click on the nonant marker, then the window returned is #f.

	* nonants.scm: Added motion-handler and make
	`get-window-with-nonant-interactively' use it so that there is
	some feedback that where you click matters.  Still needs a better
	icon, and perhaps a better marking mechanism than a message
	window.

	* highlight-current-window.scm: Added
	start-highlighting-selected-window, end-highlighting-selected-window

Wed Sep  1 19:11:01 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints.scm: Added a description field to
	ui-constraint-class objects, update vector accessors. Description
	field is to be used for tooltips, etc.

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Clean up prompts (drop "Select
	..."), use with-message-window-shown so that they don't stick
	around in case of error.  Greatly improve docs and names of
	buttons.

	* ui-constraints-buttons.scm: Use description for the tooltip text.

Wed Sep  1 18:06:18 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* property-respond.scm: Split up monolithic
	property-changed-respond function.  Added handling of 'alert
	property that is a bit less invasive than the flashing property.

	* prompt-string.scm: Have the entry widget grab the focus, and
	position the widget a bit better vertically.

	* flux-gtk.scm: Warp-to-first for
	show-window-list-matching-interactively.

Wed Sep  1 15:21:08 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window-selection.scm: Rename select-window-add-selection to
	`select-window-add', `select-window-remove', and
	`select-window-toggle'.  Added `select-matching-windows',
	`unselect-matching-windows'.  Drop the add/remove-add/remove hooks 
	-- just use `add-hook!' and `remove-hook!' instead.  Correct some
	docstring typos.

	* stylist.scm: Drop the "..." suffix/prefixes in menu names.
	Renamed `window-style-menu' to `make-window-style-menu' for cst w/ 
	make-window-group-menu.

	* flux.scm: Added Style menu to the small window ops menu.  Make
	`make-window-group-menu' have options for selecting multiple
	windows based on resource/class.

Wed Sep  1 10:29:48 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ScwmButtons.scm: Change some define-s to letrec to avoid "Bad
	define placement".

Wed Sep  1 00:37:52 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* themes.scm: Fix theme-names to not use a define after a begin to 
	avoid a bug in guile-1.3.2 (that I still see in guile-1.3.3 in
	this instance, though I'm not sure if I'm mis-linking, etc. -- the 
	scheme code is easy enough to fix here, though.

Tue Aug 31 09:26:18 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* std-menus.scm: Added a FIXME

	* focus-titlebar.scm: Added (C), improve comments.

	* Makefile.am: Added focus-titlebar.scm

Mon Aug 30 21:52:10 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* focus-titlebar.scm: Added -- support option to display titlebar
	only on the window with the focus.

Mon Aug 30 21:49:57 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Drop FIXMEs on hide/show-titlebar-in-place; I just
	fixed the bug.

Mon Aug 30 16:01:27 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xprop-extras.scm: Added `X-set-cut-buffer-string!',
	`copy-window-title-to-cut-buffer0',
	`paste-window-title-from-cut-buffer0'

	* flux.scm: Added a "Title" submenu to
	`make-small-window-ops-menu' that lets you copy and paste window titles.

Mon Aug 30 11:58:24 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* std-menus.scm: Move *xlock-query-program* definition earlier in
	file.

Mon Aug 30 10:19:42 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* std-menus.scm: Use *xlock-query-program* as a scwm-option.

Fri Aug 27 02:12:34 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* modifier-key-bindings.scm: Use #f for XKM_* variables if the
	modifier doesn't exist (instead of (cons 255 #f)).  This makes the 
	previous change effective.

Fri Aug 27 01:50:12 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* constraints.scm: Only bind modifier keys if all are non-#f.

Thu Aug 26 21:12:44 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flash-window.scm: Avoid trying to flash a window that has been
	closed (was getting an error).

	* window-selection.scm, ui-constraints.scm: Use `run-hook', not
 	`call-hook-procedures'

	* property-respond.scm: Added window-flashing-start-hook,
	window-flashing-stop-hook. 

	* minimal.scm: Define run-hook if not defined and use that
	interface, instead of always creating a new `call-hook-procedures' 
	sometimes in terms of run-hook.

Thu Aug 26 13:01:41 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: More map bug-fixes where lists were
	of different lists.  Updated the draw procs for keep-above,
	keep-left and the constructor for keep-left (ctr for keep-above
	I fixed earlier)

Wed Aug 25 16:53:08 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window-selection.scm: Use filter-map to eliminate invalid
	windows when returning the list of selected windows for
	`selected-windows-list' (e.g., when you have a selected window
	that closes itself or that you close; this was causing errors in
	other operations that were using the list of selected windows)

Wed Aug 25 15:26:19 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* nonants.scm (get-window-with-nonant): Use window-context, since
	this is used in places that `get-window' used to be used (e.g.,
	window-selection from the group menu).

	* flux.scm: Use animation, animated-iconify modules.  Move my
	make-small-window-ops-menu and make-window-group-menu into here.

Wed Aug 25 12:26:30 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Fix bug in use of map where the two
	lists were not the same length-- just shorten the second list by 1.

Wed Aug 25 11:37:13 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window-selection.scm: Use make-hook, instead of '().

	* ui-constraints.scm: Drop all the add-*-hook! and remove-*-hook!; 
	these were unnecessary all along, and code is clearer using
	add-hook! and remove-hook!.  Use make-hook instead of '().

	* ui-constraints-gtk-toggle-menu.scm, ui-constraints-buttons.scm:
 	Use add-hook!, remove-hook!  not {add,remove}-*-hook!.

	* ui-constraints-composition.scm: Drop gratuitous begin inside
	function.  Use add-hook!, remove-hook!, not {add,remove}-*-hook!

	* stylist.scm: Use make-hook, not ().

	* style.scm: ws change.

	* std-menus.scm, rgb-database.scm, path-cache.scm, flux.scm,
 	file.scm: Use popen module if minor-version > 3

	* minimal.scm: Write call-hook-procedures using run-hook if it is
	defined.

	* fvwm-module.scm: Make module-broadcast take 9 arguments, not
	rest args, since hooks now do checking on number of arguments.

	* base.scm: Define reset-hook! and make-hook! if we're using <= 1.3

Tue Aug 24 23:42:46 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* themes.scm,preferences.scm,minimal.scm,menus-extras.scm: Fix
	FIXME comments to mention guile-1.3.2, not guile-1.4.

Tue Aug 24 14:03:26 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* stylist.scm: Expose window-style-menu fn, instead of
	popup-style-menu function.

Mon Aug 23 21:11:51 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winlist.scm: Do not break with more than 36 (26+10 -- the number 
	of shortcut keys) windows in a window list.

Sun Aug 22 15:51:31 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* stylist.scm: Use gtk-label-set-text, not gtk-label-set (was
	renamed in guile-gtk package).  Make popup-style-menu public.  Do
	not use deprecated button name.

Sun Aug 22 11:38:18 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* group.scm: Added a FIXME about invoking the
	interactive-move-new-position-hook when moving windows within a
	group.

Fri Aug  6 17:33:29 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* animated-iconify.scm
	(animated-deiconify-to-last-viewport-position): Fix bugs in this.
	Was using deiconify-to-current-viewport, not just deiconify to
	actually do the final positioning of the window.

	* winlist.scm (show-window-list-menu): Make flash-window-proc,
 	unflash-window-proc default to flash-window-on and unflash-window,
 	respectively

Fri Aug  6 17:03:29 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am (scwm_common_scheme): Added register.scm

Fri Aug  6 17:00:00 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Fix `with-message-window-shown' -- do not evaluate the 
	message window argument multiple times -- just do so once and use
	that value repeatedly.

	* modifier-key-bindings.scm: Added `mod-mask-XXXX?' procs for
	testing if a modmask has a modifier set.

	* window-configuration.scm: Added `window-configuration?'

	* register.scm: Added -- similar to registers in GNU Emacs.

Fri Aug  6 12:24:17 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winlist.scm: Make hover-delay default to 0, not #f, in
	show-window-list-menu.

Tue Aug  3 16:31:48 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* modifier-key-bindings.scm: Added unbind-* procedures to undo the 
	multi-key bindings.

1999-08-04  Jeff W. Nichols  <jwnichls@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-composition.scm: Fixed an existing bug which 
	prevented the composition code from working since constructors
	were modified to take a window list parameter instead of several
	window parameters.

1999-08-02  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* number-convert.scm, menus-extras.scm,
	highlight-current-window.scm, flash-window.scm, face.scm,
	dir-focus.scm, base.scm, animated-iconify.scm, ScwmClock.scm,
	ScwmButtons.scm, ScwmBiff.scm: Documented a bunch of public
	functions (dir-focus.scm, also made some functions private instead 
	of documenting them).

1999-08-01  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Added some FIXME comments.

Sat Jul 31 20:10:56 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* constraints.scm: Use bind-four-modifier-key-events; was
	conflicting with some bindings in gjb.scwmrc.

	* modifier-key-bindings.scm: Added bind-four-modifier-key-events

Fri Jul 30 16:12:08 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints.scm: Need listops module for filter-map proc.

	* winops.scm: Switch to 'northwest gravity on maximization to work 
	around a bug.  

Tue Jul 27 13:32:56 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Initialize the vector to return with 
	#f, not 0, in nonant->dirvector.

1999-07-29  Jeff W. Nichols  <jwnichls@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Added a method to sort a list of 
	windows based on the position of their middle.

	* ui-constraints-composition.scm: Adapted 
	ui-constraints-composition to work with the 
	window-selection module.  If the correct number of
	selections exists, selected windows will be used to
	create the constraint rather than prompting.

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Adapted keep-above and 
	keep-to-left-of constraint classes to work with the
	window-selection module and two or more selections.
	Constraints are based on window position.

1999-07-28  Jeff W. Nichols  <jwnichls@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Added support for using the
	new nonant selection abilities of window-selection to the
	ui constructors of ui-constraints-classes.

	* window-selection.scm: Modified the show-selected-nonants
	and hide-selected-nonants methods to turn on and off all
	nonant markers.

1999-07-28  Jeff W. Nichols  <jwnichls@cs.washington.edu>

	* window-selection.scm: Added new code for nonant markers. 
	The nonant selected at the time of the window is marked until
	the window is deselected.  This feature will later be used 
	by constraints.

	* window-locations.scm: Removed get-window-nonant method and
	moved it to nonants.scm.

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Add import of nonants module.

	* nonants.scm: Add import of base module.

	* flux.scm: Removed window-locations import and added 
	nonants import.  The get-window-nonant method moved between
	these two modules.

	* Makefile.am: Added nonants.scm to the list of modules.

1999-07-27  Jeff W. Nichols  <jwnichls@cs.washington.edu>

	* nonants.scm: A new module containing the all of the general
	purpose nonant methods.  The purpose of this was to get a 
	couple nonant routines out of misc. other modules. 
 	
	* gnome-hints.scm: Modified the viewport-position-change-hook 
	use in this module to conform to the new four argument format.

Sun Jul 25 15:40:00 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Added a bunch of files that were missing.  Used
	"make check";  thanks Stephen Tell for noticing I needed the new
	files listed.

Sun Jul 25 13:21:05 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window-selection.scm: Be sure unselect-all-windows succeeds--
	use a catch and check for window-valid? before trying to unflash
	the windows in the list.

	* group.scm: Remove extraneous top-level expression.

Sat Jul 24 22:14:23 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints.scm, window-selection.scm: s/-hook-list/-hook/g;
 	the longer name is a bit redundant and inconsistent.  Also, the
 	various add and remove procs should get replaced with a single
 	interface that works from both Scheme and C.  This stuff has
 	changed a bit in guile-1.3.1, too, complicating matters.

	* tile.scm: Use `move-window', not `move-to'; fixes
	viewport/virtual bug.

	* listops.scm: Added FIXME re: `filter-map' ignoring
	#unspecified-s, too, as a convenience.

Sat Jul 24 20:55:16 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints.scm: Added `ui-constraints-involving-window',
	`delete-ui-constraints-involving-window!' and use the latter on
	the window-close-hook

Sat Jul 24 19:57:04 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-buttons.scm: Only enable a constraint if
	make-ui-constraint-interactively returns non-#f.

Sat Jul 24 19:02:58 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints.scm: Use message-window.  Fix mis-naming of
	constraint-class-remove-hook-list to
	constraint-class-delete-hook-list. Change error messages to
	mention function name so it's easier to figure out what went
	wrong.  Display a message window if a ui-constraint cannot be made 
	interactively.

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Change two-window-prompter to bail
	once a window is not picked.  Use two-window-prompter only for
	ui-cnctr-{[hv]size,strict-relpos}.  Added one-window-prompter, and 
	use it.  Use eqv? not eq? for testing numbers.  Just use booleans
	for their truth values instead of testing w/ eq?.

	* base.scm: Ensure MWN is a message-window in
	with-message-window-shown.  Clean up select-window-interactively.

Sat Jul 24 14:47:44 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Fix some little cut and paste bugs.
	Correct names of pixmaps for the min-[hv]size pictures.

1999-07-24  Jeff W. Nichols  <jwnichls@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints.scm: Added a check to 
	make-ui-constraint-class such that when adding a 
	new constraint class all existing constraint classes
	with that name were deleted.

	* ui-constraints-buttons.scm: Used object properties to
	associate button with constraint class and added method
	to remove the associated button when a constraint class
	was removed.  Also modified window properties so that 
	button window would shrink as buttons were removed.

Fri Jul 23 23:32:16 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* path-cache.scm: Typo fix: :use-module, not :use-modules.

	* ui-constraints-buttons.scm: Added newline at end of file.

1999-07-22  Jeff Nichols  <jwnichls@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Finished modifying the
	ui constructors for working with the window-selection
	module.  All constraint classes may be constructed by
	pre-selecting windows using the window-selection 
	module.  NOTE: Compositions are an exception for now.

	* window-selection.scm: Added hooks which are called
	when windows are added and removed from the selection
	list.

1999-07-22  Jeff Nichols  <jwnichls@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints.scm: Updated comments on structure of
	a UI-CONSTRAINT-CLASS pseudo-object.

	* ui-constraints-toggle-menu.scm: Added menu items for 
	starting and stopping the recording of a composition per
	request of Greg Badros.

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Added support for the window
	selection utility to several of the constraint classes. 
	With the supported classes, it is now possible to select 
	windows using the window-selection module and then click 
	the button in the button bar to constrain those windows.
	In some cases, support has been added for constraining an
	arbitrary number of windows.

Wed Jul 21 18:04:05 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* path-cache.scm: Needs string-fun module.

1999-07-21  Jeff Nichols  <jwnichls@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-buttons.scm: Modified and updated the
	standard ui-constraints button panel to be more configurable
	(pixmaps and layout are settable) and support the dynamic 
	addition of constraint classes (necessary for dealing with
	ui-constraint-compositions).

Tue Jul 20 11:17:04 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Needed highlight-current-window module.

Tue Jul 20 11:16:40 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* path-cache.scm: Added `program-exists?' using search-path
	(thanks Bernard Urban!), and use it instead of which when zsh does 
	not exist.

Mon Jul 19 16:54:55 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* group.scm: ws change.

	* flux.scm: Added interactive-move-selected-group-or-window

	* highlight-current-window.scm:  Added (moved from gjb.scwmrc).

Mon Jul 19 15:17:01 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* minimal.scm: Do not invoke set-rubber-band-mask! -- that gets
	done via C code to ensure that the GC is already initialized.

Sun Jul 18 16:31:26 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Update describe-key to handle new list format for
	get-key-event.  Added `describe-mouse'.

	* quote.scm: Added; for quoting keystroke and mouse events.
	Requires xtest extension for now, and includes other useful xtest
	abstractions.

Sun Jul 18 13:44:43 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Added WIN args to a lot of procs that used to only
	work on the curent-window.

Sun Jul 18 01:31:32 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Get rid of add-timer-hook for describe-key;  fixed
	`get-key-event' primitive instead.

Sun Jul 18 00:33:42 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Added `add-ms-timer-hook!' for convenience since usec
	are almost never what I want.

Sat Jul 17 23:58:52 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* dir-focus.scm: Some tweaks to make work better (some bugfixes,
	probably; I'm ignoring dir-focus.gwm now).

Sat Jul 17 23:43:06 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* wininfo.scm: Make `visible?' check that the window is not
	iconified, too.

	* dir-focus.scm: Added.  Ported from GWM WOOL source.

Sat Jul 17 23:08:43 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* gnome-hints.scm: Do not window shade the Gnome Panel (prints a
	warning message for now).  From Robert Bihlmeyer's patch to the
	list on 28 Mar 1999.

Sat Jul 17 21:23:41 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* minimal.scm: Fix uses of obsoleted contexts.

	* face.scm: Added `set-left-button-face!',
	`set-right-button-face!' to avoid needing to deal with the stupid
	fvwm2 numbering convention.

Sat Jul 17 19:59:56 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* animated-iconify.scm: Set 'last-viewport-position property in
	animated-iconify, and add
	animated-deiconify-to-last-viewport-position to bring it back
	to where (relative to the viewport) it was before

	* ScwmButtons.scm: Added some bugs notes.

	* flux.scm: Added `procedure->string', `context->string',
	`raw-binding->string', `procedure->bindings-description' (for
	doing scwm-whereis, among other things).

Sat Jul 17 16:15:43 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* listops.scm: Fix commments for iota, reverse-iota (starts/ends
	at 0, not 1).

Sat Jul 17 02:06:39 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* modifier-key-bindings.scm, message-window.scm: doc fixes.

	* minimal.scm: Make process-use-scwm-module private.
	
	* key-mover-xtest.scm: Added.

	* winops.scm, wininfo.scm, window-locations.scm,
	window-configuration.scm: Doc fixes, rename formals in some cases.

Fri Jul 16 17:34:11 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* message-window.scm: Added optional shaped argument to
	make-message-window-with-image, pass it along to
	message-window-set-image!

	* flux.scm: Needed to use `tile' module for tile interactively.

1999-07-15  Jeff Nichols  <jwnichls@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-composition.scm: Added a new module to support the
	construction of constraint "compositions".  The interface to this 
	module exists purely through scheme function calls for now, but a 
	graphical ui is coming.  With this module, you may record a series of
	ui-constraint applications and then compile that set into a "composition"
	that you can then reuse as a new constraint type.

	* ui-constraints.scm: Added a new option to the make-ui-constraint
	function.  This new option, in the form of the key visible?, specifies
	whether or not the newly constructed ui-constraint should be added to
	the global list or not.  The add hooks are also not called if the 
	ui-constraint is not added to the list.

	* ui-constraints.scm: Added a function to obtain a ui-constraint-class
	object given it's textual name.  This routine could easily be generalized
	to fetch based on any property should that feature become necessary.
  	
	* Makefile.am: Added ui-constraints-composition.scm to the list
	scheme modules.

Thu Jul 15 09:40:32 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Make `select-window' return the (car
	(select-viewport-position)) iff it is a window? object --
	otherwise return #f;  now select-viewport-position returns a
	window ID integer as its car, but that would break too much code
	using `select-window' expecting a #f for no-window.

Thu Jul 15 09:31:43 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* minimal.scm: Added note re: environment-bound? in G1.4

Tue Jul 13 23:11:55 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* message-window.scm: Added `make-message-window-with-image'
	convenience procedure.

	* flash-window.scm: Added `window-flashing?', docs. Have
	`flash-window-on' return the window it flashed.

	* minimal.scm, base.scm: Move `call-hook-procedures' into
 	minimal.scm from base.scm, and make the use-scwm-modules stuff
 	call the load-processing-hook
 	(for showing startup progress (e.g., animating spinning logo)).

1999-07-13  Jeff Nichols  <jwnichls@cs.washington.edu>

	* window-locations.scm: Added window-center-middle procedure for
	returning a point that corresponds to the exact middle of the window.
	The return format is the same as other routines within the module.

	* ui-constraints.scm: Reorganized the hook procedures so that they
	all occurred in the same place in the file.  Added new hooks that 
	are called whenever a constraint class is added or removed from 
	the global list.  This will allow the ui-constraints-button window
	to respond dynamically to newly added compositions.  Also added a 
	new hook to support compositions which is called everytime a constraint
	is added.  This is similar to the constraint-add hook which exists,
	except that is passes the constructor argument list as a parameter
	to the hook function.

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Generalized the alignment constraints 
	to have vertical and horizontal alignment constraint class over 
	the previous align-tops, align-left, etc.  Added relative,
	minimum, and maximum size constraint class.  Added a strict 
	relative position constraint class.  Also changed instances of 
	quadrant to nonant (a clearer name).  The module also no longer 
	requires the simple-constraints module.

Fri Jul  9 15:13:16 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Added `describe-key' moved here from gjb.scwmrc

Wed Jul  7 15:39:24 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* fvwm-eval.scm: Patch from Danius Michaelides to add support for
 	the MoveToDesk command

Mon Jul  5 17:38:16 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* preferences.scm: Move *favorite-colors* option into
	prompt-color.scm.  Somehow it can't access the option even if that 
	module is used, so I turn it off, below, too.  For another day's
	wondering... 

	* prompt-color.scm: Use defoption, but comment out the
	*favorite-colors* option -- something isn't kosher but I've not
	time now to look into it.

Mon Jul  5 17:14:46 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Biggish cleanup of some of the newer 
	code to make a bit better scheme style.  Rename quadvec->string to 
	dirvector->string. Renamed quadrant->vector to nonant->dirvector.
	use #t/#f in dirvector-s, not 1/0.

Mon Jul  5 17:07:43 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Fix typo, make `interactive-set-window-gravity!' more
 	robust.

	* base.scm: Added `with-message-window-shown' macro.  Switch order 
	of args to seelct-window, select-viewport-position -- the cursor
	is first, now.

Mon Jul  5 15:50:34 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Added `nonant->gravity',
	`interactive-set-window-gravity' using a nifty pixmap cursor of an 
	anchor.  Use window-locations module for get-window-nonant.

	* window-locations.scm: Rename `get-window-quadrant' to more
	accurate `get-window-nonant', and fix its documentation a bit.

Mon Jul  5 15:47:38 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* snap.scm: Patch from Danius Michaelides-- bug fix, avoid
	infinite loop.  Also no longer mess with the new-position-hooks;
	snapping only occurs at the end of the move.

Sun Jul  4 23:55:03 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Added `keycode->keysym', in terms of
	`keymask-keycode->string'.

Sun Jul  4 21:15:39 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Added toggle-titlebar-in-place toggling winop.

	* flux.scm: Added `tile-windows-interactively',
	`enclosing-rectangle', and `window-corners'.

Sun Jul  4 19:01:13 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* prompt-color.scm: Make favorites default to
	*favorite-colors*. Fixed bug in not setting title in advance, and
	calling prompt-color-hbox with arguments in the wrong order.

	* preferences.scm: Added option `*favorite-colors*'

	* edge-ops.scm: Move module variables before the scwm-option that
	uses one of them.

	* base.scm: Drop #:favorites from color options -- Thanks Carl
	Witty for this suggestion!

Sun Jul  4 14:02:03 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* fvwm-module.scm: Fix bug: M_ICONIFY_WINDOW was used, not
	M_ICONIFY.  Can we get better error messages (e.g., a backtrace)
	on a packet eval?  This was way too hard to find given how simple
	the bug is.

	* fvwm-eval.scm: Added some comments.

Sat Jul  3 22:42:59 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* prompt-proc.scm: Fix let* bug in prompt-proc-hbox. Also, return
	the entry, too, so that an "activate" signal on the text widget
	can exit.

Sat Jul  3 22:00:26 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* std-menus.scm: Use defoption module. make *context-map*'s
	procedures have names so they can be read in.

	* preferences.scm: Make procedure reader from port work on
	procedures that have arguments.

	* minimal.scm: Fix process-use-scwm-modules error handling to have 
	the second proc take (key . args).

	* menus-extras.scm: Use defoption module.  Added range and
	favorites to *menu-max-fold-lines*

	* edge-ops.scm: Use defoption module.

Sat Jul  3 20:48:24 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm, flux.scm: Rename `move-opaquely?' to
 	`*move-opaquely-proc*', `resize-opaquely?' to
 	`*resize-opaquely-proc*'; make them scwm-options.

	* std-menus.scm: Rename `context-map' to `*context-map*' and make
	it a scwm-option.

	* preferences.scm: Added `dummy-prompt-hbox' for unknown types,
	and handle them reasonably gracefully.

	* minimal.scm: ws change

	* menu-extras.scm: Rename `default-menu-max-fold-lines' to
	`*menu-max-fold-lines*' and make scwm-option.

	* edge-ops.scm: Rename `samf-edge-scroll-delay' to
	`*edge-ops-scroll-delay*', `edge-ops-scroll-backoff' to
	`*edge-ops-scroll-backoff*'. Make them scwm-options.

	* defoption.scm: Added 'alist:re->string type in documentation
	(still unsupported).

Sat Jul  3 19:51:35 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* preferences.scm: Use my new `eval-after-load' to protect against
 	undefined symbols.

	* minimal.scm: Added `scwm-module-loaded?'  and `eval-after-load'
	features.  Make `use-scwm-modules' return a list with the modules
	that succeeded in it, instead of just list of booleans.  Also,
	improve error handling by calling handle-system-error when a
	module does not load properly.

	* flux.scm: ws change.

	* defoption.scm: Save the module name with the scwm-option so that 
	they the option remembers what needs to be loaded to access it and 
	does not try to set! an undefined variable.

Sat Jul  3 00:15:25 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* std-menus.scm: ws change

	* message-window.scm: Added `make-message-window-win-copy',
	`with-frozen-root-window'

Fri Jul  2 22:34:48 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* wmconfig-menu.scm: Added comment about resizing the image.

Sat Jun 26 16:56:53 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* prefs-menu.scm: Added note about obsolescence-- do not want to
	remove it yet, though.

Sat Jun 26 13:30:47 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* tests/demo.scm: Added some extra sample code.

	* tests/windows-matching.scm: Added.

	* tests/cursor.scm: Added

Sat Jun 26 13:09:54 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* number-convert.scm: Added

	* xprop-extras.scm: Added comment.

	* netscape.scm: Added uri-escapify-comma, use it in
	netscape-goto-url so that uri's with embedded commas get handled
	properly.

	* listops.scm: Updated comment to point MS at an incomplete
	comment. 

1999-05-16  Jeff W. Nichols  <jwnichls@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-buttons.scm: A change required by 
	ui-constraints-gdk-drawing.  The gdk drawing module requires a 
	visible gtk window to initialize.  Since the constraint buttons
	are always available, they seemed like a good choice.

	* ui-constraints-gdk-drawing.scm: A module that essentially 
	duplicates the functionality of xlib-drawing except that it goes
	through gdk to do so.  Requires the latest version of guile-gtk
	from cvs.

	* ui-constraints-gtk-toggle-menu.scm: Gave the toggle menu window 
	a better name.

Tue May 11 15:06:11 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Added some missing files.

Sun May  9 14:44:11 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* property-respond.scm: Added; handles flash, flashing property
	changes on windows.  Very useful with my xterm patch to permit a
	control sequence to set an X property.

	* flash-window.scm: Use "red" as the default, and make the color
	inside the function, and use red when the make-color returns a
	non-color.

	* doc.scm (documentation): Permit matching the initial substring
	of the line, since hooks now have the number of arguments appended 
	to the end of the line in the scwm-hooks.txt file and they were
	not matching.

	* base.scm (maybe-make-color): Wrap in a catch to handle color
	parse errors, and return #f in those cases.

Fri May  7 08:37:03 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* message-window.scm: Default to 14 point font, not 24 pt.

1999-05-04  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* stylist.scm: Made a proper module.
	(select-style-for): Unified color and boolean options.
	Options are now in a table, with activation checkbuttons to their
	right. Options only contribute to the style if active.

Tue May  4 16:19:55 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* auto-raise.scm: Added missing use-module of (app scwm style)

	* prompt-string.scm: Use * 8, not 10, as the factor for text
	widths.  Still not right -- should find the width of the text in
	the font in use.

Tue May  4 16:19:00 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* tests/demo.scm: Added bigger icons for run-ScwmButtons demo.

Tue May  4 14:29:23 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux-gtk.scm: Fix prompt in
	show-window-list-matching-interactively, use time-convert module

Tue May  4 12:41:59 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux-gtk.scm: Added `show-window-list-matching-interactively'.

	* flash-window.scm: Convert from string colors to color objects.

1999-05-03  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* stylist.scm: New file, GTK interface to the window-style system.

	* stringops.scm (string-join): Return null string instead of #f.

	* xprop-extras.scm (MWH-*, MWF-*, MWD-*): New flag constants for
	_MOTIF_WM_HINTS. 
	(mwm-functions->string, mwm-decorations->string): New functions
	decoding parts of _MOTIF_WM_HINTS.
	(X-properties->string): Handle _MOTIF_WM_HINTS.
	Represent unknown types as a list of hex values - these were lumped
	together with CARDINAL/INTEGER and in decimal.

Mon May  3 11:38:41 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ScwmBiff.scm: Patch from Glenn Trigg to fix some X warnings.

Sun May  2 18:03:07 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flash-window.scm: Added #:continually option to flash-window,
	added `stop-flashing-window' to turn the flashing off.

Sun May  2 15:29:59 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-gtk-toggle-menu.scm: Added commented out code for 
	testing at the top of the file.

	* flux.scm: Rename move-all-windows-relative to
 	move-nonsticky-windows-relative since the latter is the right
	thing (arguably, of course).

Sun May  2 09:29:49 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* gtk.scm: Added `gtk-window->scwm-window' but relies on a new
	primitive not in guile-gtk-0.16 yet.

1999-05-02  Jeff W Nichols  <jwnichls@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-gtk-toggle-menu.scm: Fixed the enabling/disabling
	ability of the toggle menu.  The checkbox is updated regardless of
	where the ui-constraint is enabled or disabled.
	Also modified the routine that shows the toggle menu to auto-
	initialize the toggle-menu if it has not been initialized yet.

Sat May  1 19:08:41 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am (scwm_common_scheme): Added
	ui-constraints-gtk-toggle-menu.scm to be installed.

1999-05-01  Jeff W Nichols  <jwnichls@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-gtk-toggle-menu.scm: Created a new constraint
	instance widget.  Allows enabling/disabling and removal of constraints
	from the toggle menu.  Enabling/disabling currently does not work.

	* ui-constraints.scm: Removed the disable-hook from the 
	ui-constraint-class in favor of allowing a similar hook for
	each ui-constraint instance.

Sat May  1 18:03:40 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ScwmButtons.scm: Turn on auto-orient in example.

Sat May  1 17:51:55 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Simplify and fix `move-to'.

	* auto-raise.scm: Move the `provide' to the end-- causes
 	inexplicably problems when (use-module (app scwm auto-raise) is at
 	the start of my .scwmrc file if the provide is at the beginning of 
	this file.  Very strange, indeed!

	* animation.scm: Simplify and correct `animated-move-to' -- some
	of the extra junk seems to have been added (maybe by me!) as
	workarounds to the bug in convert_move_data that I just fixed.

Sat May  1 14:36:34 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* prompt-color.scm: Use maybe-make-color in apply, and fix bogus
	let bindings when mis-edited before.

Sat May  1 13:43:18 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* prompt-color.scm: Permit "#f" and "inherit" as values in color
	selection (should be split into color-or-inherit type).

	* base.scm: Added "inherit" to favorites list for
	menu-hl-fg-color, menu-hl-bg-color.

	* tests/demo.scm: Use auto-orient feature of ScwmButtons -- also
	fix the class name in the window-style (it's ScwmButtons again,
	not ScwmButtons2).

Sat May  1 11:40:54 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ScwmButtons.scm: New version from Glenn Trigg-- adds auto-orient 
	options.  Slightly updated by me to use-scwm-modules, and
	commented out debugging display-s.

	* base.scm: Permit "#f" and "inherit" to mean use #f for the color 
	setting (to allow menu-hl-fg-color, menu-hl-bg-color to inherit
	menu-fg-color, menu-bg-color).

Fri Apr 30 16:14:50 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* undo.scm: Added... support for multi-level undo using a partial
	global state.  Keybindings using H- are defined, and saving states 
	must be done manually (until we get a reasonable advice mechanism
	so we can do this w/o adding code to other modules).  This is not
	completely, but decided I'd check it in anyway so people can see
	that it has no impact on the size of the system unless you use it.

1999-04-30  Jeff W Nichols  <jwnichls@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-gtk-toggle-menu.scm: Changed the flash and
	unflash routines (that are very similar to those in 
	ui-constraints-toggle-menu.scm) to take a window list as 
	described below.  Also added constraint drawing and erasing 
	on enter and exit from a menu button.  This makes flashing
	consistent with the regular toggle menu.

	* ui-constraints-toggle-menu.scm: Changed the 
	flash-windows-of-constraint and accompanied unflash
	routine to take a window list rather than a cn.  This ensures
	that anchor constraints flash even though their cn does not
	point directly at a window.

1999-04-29  Jeff W Nichols  <jwnichls@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-gtk-toggle-menu.scm: Added code to support auto-
	removal of buttons from the window when a ui-constraint object 
	is removed.  Also fixed a bug where you could not initialize the
	gtk-toggle-window after constraints were created.

	* ui-constraints.scm: Added a field to the ui-constraint object
	for holding the button used in the gtk-toggle-window.  Also fixed
	a bug in delete-ui-constraint! in which the constraint was not 
	removed from the solver when the ui-constraint object was 
	removed.

Wed Apr 28 19:49:31 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* tests/demo.scm: Minor changes from just before demoing Scwm to RMS.

1999-04-28  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* flux.scm (X-properties->string): Moved to xprop-extras.scm.
	* xprop-extras.scm (X-properties->string): Moved from flux.scm.

Tue Apr 27 21:03:52 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* tests/demo.scm: Added -- sample code showing lots of features of 
	  Scwm.  For RMS, and also for Linux User's of Victoria Scwm talk
	  on 4-May-1999 (GMT+10).

Tue Apr 27 20:53:32 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window-selection.scm: Add a timer hook to call
	  handle-pending-events while doing the next select.  Looks a
	  little bit nicer for me, even though it introduces a harmless
	  race for the correct behaviour.  Use time-convert module for the 
	  hook.

	* preferences.scm: Added ";; -*- scwm -*-" prefix when writing out 
	  the options file.

	* message-window.scm:  Change default size to 24pt, not 10pt --
	  10pt was too small.

	* flux-gtk.scm: Use-modules xprop-extras, needed for
	  set-window-title!

	* base.scm: Use 'menu-title-font in `menu-title', not (opt-get
	  *menu-title-font*) (we want the default font to be whatever is
	  in 'menu-title-font so it'll change dynamically).

	* ScwmButtons.scm: Added tooltip arguments for sample code.

1999-04-26  Jeff W. Nichols  <jwnichls@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-gtk-toggle-menu.scm: Modified the gtk toggle
	window to work in realtime.  The window can either be used as 
	popup or as a permanent window which updates as constraints are
	added.  Currently does not update when constraints are removed.

	* ui-constraints.scm: Fixed some inefficiencies in the 
	ui-constraint-class-disable-hook.  Also added constraint-add
	and constraint-delete hooks using the 'call-hook-procedures'
	method just added by Greg (see below).

Mon Apr 26 08:16:54 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Added `call-hook-procedures' for some basic
	  scheme-level support of invoking a hook list.

	* ui-constraints-gtk-toggle-menu.scm: ws change, do use-module on
	  flash-window as it *is* needed (was commented out).

1999-04-25  Jeff W. Nichols  <jwnichls@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-gtk-toggle-menu.scm: Added a new toggle menu for
	the constraint user interface which uses GTK.  This is the initial
	step towards making an easier and more functional toggle menu.

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Commented out a line that caused
	the constraint system to be reset everytime this module was used.

Sun Apr 25 18:50:32 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-toggle-menu.scm: Added missing use-module of (app
	  scwm flash-window) that I forgot to introduce before.  Drop use
	  of flux.scm.  Added #:hover-delay of 100 (better when demoing).

Sun Apr 25 16:22:57 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* wmconfig-menu.scm, winlist.scm, std-menus.scm, preferences.scm,
	  flux.scm: Use menu-title instead of menu-item for titles, use
	  menu-separator exclusively for separators (not menu-title any
	  longer, since it is no longer an alias for menu-separator)

	* ui-constraints-toggle-menu.scm: Use menuitem, menu-title, not
	  make-menuitem.

	* base.scm: Added menu-title-font var, *menu-title-font* option,
	  set-default-menu-title-font! setter, #:title-font #:hl-{fg,bg}
	  options to menu-style.  Make `menu-title' a proper procedure
	  instead of an alias for menu-separator.

	* listops.scm: Added `flatten'

Sun Apr 25 16:14:31 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* test-case.scm: Added (from tests/test.scm)

Fri Apr 23 09:25:04 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winlist.scm: ws change.

	* themes.scm, menus-extras.scm: Use sort module

	* prompt-string.scm, preferences.scm, flux-gtk.scm: fix
 	occurrences of string-prompt to now current name prompt-string

Thu Apr 22 20:39:07 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ScwmClock.scm, ScwmButtons.scm, ScwmBiff.scm: New versions from
 	Glenn Trigg.

Thu Apr 22 17:00:10 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xprop-extras.scm: Addes some sample code in comments

Thu Apr 22 16:46:49 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xprop-extras.scm: Added `window-other-id' to access the
	SCWM_OTHER_ID environment variable of the running process.

Wed Apr 21 16:17:54 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm, group.scm: Switch order of args in get-window calls.

	* base.scm: Switch order of args in select-window, and rename
	kill? to cursor.

Tue Apr 20 21:12:07 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xprop-extras.scm: Added `window-pid'

	* minimal.scm: Turn off using handle-system-error in
	use-scwm-modules as it causes immediate exiting for me -- I
	thought this had worked before.  Also added a mouse binding to
	enable deiconify action on icons since sometimes you need to be
	able to deiconify an icon to do something to an xterm from within
	a super-minimal scwm.

	* file.scm: Added `first-line-output-of-system-cmd' to avoid
	blocking waiting for more output, and added `execute-with-pidprop' 
	to support the scwm_set_pid_property mechanism for using
	`window-pid' primitive.

	* base.scm: Change `scwm-system' to return a list -- exit-status
	and child-pid.  Add doc that the child-pid is not CMD, but the sh
	that is used to exec the CMD.  Other doc fixes.

1999-04-19  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* flux.scm (WH-*): New constants, being the flag values of WM_HINTS.
	(WSH-*): New constants, being the flag valuse of WM_SIZE_HINTS.
	(X-properties->string): New function, which generates a readable
	listing of X properties of a window (like xprop(1) does).
	(show-X-properties): New function, which displays a message window
	with the output of `X-properties->string'.
	
	* listops.scm (repeat): New function, to generate lists of
	repeating values.
	* stringops.scm (number->hex-string): New function, converts a
	number to its hex representation.
	(window-state->string): New function, converts X11's window-state
	to a human-readable form.
	(gravity->string): New function, converts X11's gravity to a
	human-readable form.
	(string-join): New function, like Perl's `join'.

Mon Apr 19 20:19:15 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* preferences.scm: Added `save-preferences', `load-preferences'.
	These should work, modulo the option variable referencing problem
	due to variables possibly being hidden inside modules.

1999-04-19  Jeff Nichols  <jwnichls@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Added an anchor constraint class.
	This is a multi-purpose class which can anchor a window in any
	way possible.  This replaces the former keep-top-at-value, 
	keep-right-at-value, and keep-left-at-value constraints.
	Also added a generic routine to generate a constructor function
	for the existing constraints which matches the new return values
	that are expected by the ui-constraint code.

	* ui-constraints.scm: Added an optional disable-hook parameter 
	to the ui-constraints-class object.  This hook is called whenever
	an instance is enabled or disabled.
	Modified the ui-constraint-instance format to have a list of cn
	objects associated with it rather than a single cn value.  This
	required modifications in make-ui-constraint and the enable and
	disable functions.
	Modified the expected return values of the instance constructors.
	The ui-constructor is now expected to return the appropriate 
	argument list for the regular constructor.  The regular constructor
	can take any values, rather than just a window list as before.
	The regular constructor is now expected to return a list of at 
	least two elements, the cn-list and the window-list.  It may 
	optionally put more items in this list.  Those items are placed
	in the optional data section of the ui-constraint object.

	* ui-constraints-toggle-menu.scm: Modified the window flashing 
	code to look for a list of cn values rather than a single cn.
	Makes the toggle menu conform to the new format for a 
	ui-constraint object.

	* window-locations.scm: Added 'get-window-quadrant' for getting 
	the obtaining the location within a window in which the user 
	clicked when using select-viewport-position.  Also fixed changed
	window-size to window-frame-size in window-left-middle.

1999-04-15  Sam Steingold  <sds@goems.com>

	* flux.scm (window-info): added `get-window-focus'.

Thu Apr 15 19:39:17 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window-selection.scm: In select-multiple-windows-interactively,
	call handle-pending-events so any selection actions get processed
	by scwm.  Especially useful in
	delete-multiple-windows-interactively, since otherwise the killed
	windows do not unmap and it can be hard to select the next window
	if it's obscured by a dead one.

	* flux.scm: Use window-selection module (needed by
	delete-multiple-windows-interactively)

Thu Apr 15 19:15:09 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Added window-selection.scm to install list

	* std-menus.scm, flux.scm: Moved `execute-on-selection',
 	`exe-on-selection' from flux.scm

	* window-selection.scm: Added-- way cool (IIDSSM) window selection
	stuff that does even cooler things with group.scm (even w/o the
	constraint solver!)

	* flux.scm: Moved window selection stuff into new window-selection.scm

	* flash-window.scm: Added flash-window-on, giving #:unflash-delay #f.

	* minimal.scm: Try to report errors better when loading modules;
	reverse the module list before calling process-use-scwm-modules so
	it more closely matches what use-modules would've done.

	* group.scm: Added `group-window' to give a window from a group
	(since a group may now be a list).  Use it to make
	interactive-move-group work.  Use a dynamic-wind to be sure the
	interactive-move-new-position-hook gets the drag-other-along
	callback removed even in case of error.

1999-04-14  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* wininfo.scm: Use module (app scwm winlist) to import
	`list-windows'.

Wed Apr 14 20:30:38 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winlist.scm: Use flash-window module.

	* base.scm: Fix move-window-relative to use x,y, not dx,dy

Wed Apr 14 10:10:06 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am (scwm_common_scheme): List all the other missing
	.scm files that I added yesterday.  I need to run make check more
	regularly!

Wed Apr 14 10:06:33 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* minimal.scm: Added `use-scwm-modules' macro,
	`process-use-scwm-modules' procedure.  Simplifies and makes using
	modules from .scwmrcs much more robust.

Tue Apr 13 19:55:14 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* stringops.scm, file.scm: Move `write-all' to stringops.scm from
 	file.scm

	* preferences.scm: Use `scwm-option-set!', not just `set!' for
	setting the options in the string to be written to file.

	* doc.scm: use stringops.

1999-04-13  Sam Steingold  <sds@goems.com>

	* Makefile.am (scwm_common_scheme): added stringops.scm.

Tue Apr 13 19:08:12 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Moved lots of functionality out into other/new modules
	(the additions below are from flux.scm);  some re-arrangement.

	* file.scm: Added `write-all', `read-until-eof',
	`output-of-system-cmd'

	* base.scm: Use hash-fold for hash-table->alist if it is available
	(it is in newer guiles).  Rewrote move-window-relative using
	delta-position, and added `delta-position'.  Added
	`run-dot-xclients-at-startup' and `run-dot-xclients-script'.

	* winlist.scm: Turn off enumerate-hotkeys option if by-resource
	option is on.  Added `select-window-from-window-list'.

	* wininfo.scm: Added from flux.scm: `find-window-by',
	`find-window-by-name', `find-window-by-class-resource'.  Rewrote
	the latter two to use the ?? matcher procedures.

	* prefs-menu.scm: New use-modules for possible new dependencies.
	Is there any good way to check for dependencies?

	* message-window.scm: Added `display-message-briefly!'

	* listops.scm: Added `list-without-elem'.

	* flash-window.scm: New module with `flash-window',
	`unflash-window'

	* key-mover.scm: New module with `key-mouse-moves' and
	`key-viewport-moves'

	* netscape.scm: New module with various netscape functionality
	enhancements.

	* send-string.scm: New module with synthetic events code.

	* stringops.scm: New module with
	`make-string-usable-for-resource-key', `bool->string',
	`color->string', `size->string', `chop-newline', `to-string'

	* xprop-extras.scm: New module with `set-window-title!',
	`X-cut-buffer-string', `get-wm-command',
	`X-atomic-property-set-if-unset!'

Mon Apr 12 19:12:56 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-buttons.scm: Call gtk-widget-show on the buttons
	before the pixmaps (avoids some gtk warnings for me, I think).

	* gtk.scm: Use find-file-in-path for
	gtk-pixmap-new-search-scwm-path.

	* group.scm: Permit `group->windows' to take a list of windows as
	the group, and just return it.  Thus, we can use flux.scm's new
	`selected-windows-list' proc and treat the highlighted windows as
	a group.

	* flux.scm: Drop
	`select-window-interactively-and-highlight'. Added
	`selected-windows-list', `select-window-and-toggle-highlight',
	`unselect-all-windows'.  Fix `flash-window' and `unflash-window'
	to be a bit more robust.  (How do you delete object properties?)

	* constraints.scm: Do not call (start-constraints) at load time.

Mon Apr 12 17:55:24 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* preferences.scm: Added `scwm-options-string' proc to return a
	string that can be evaluated to set all the options to the values
	that they are currently.  Added read-{color,font,proc} and use
	them via read-hash-extend so that colors, fonts, and procedures
	can be read in from their printable forms (procedures with some
	obvious module-related snafus).  This goes a long way to making
	preferences persistable!

Mon Apr 12 17:49:15 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* themes.scm: Do not catch errors-- it's far more useful to see
	the error output for now.

1999-04-11  Todd Larason  <jtl@molehill.org>

	* image-loaders.scm ((support-image-conversion)): don't actually
	do anything if ImLib is being used - it's not needed, and it won't
	work, since xpm-load won't be there.

Mon Apr 12 08:16:42 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Fixed some leftover hl-color-text (renamed to hl-color-fg)

Sun Apr 11 19:26:56 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Added *menu-hl-bg-color*, *menu-hl-fg-color* options.
	Added `maybe-make-color'.  Added hl-color-fg, hl-color-bg,
	hl-relief? options to `menu' proc.  Some doc fixes.

Sun Apr 11 17:47:07 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* virtual.scm: Fix window-position-in-viewport to ensure that at
	least half of the width and half of the height of the window is
	put in the current viewport.  (Was just favoring the top-left
	point of the window).

Sun Apr 11 17:32:05 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winlist.scm: Added enumerate-hotkeys option to
	`show-window-list-menu'; Thanks to Eric Beuscher for patch!

Sun Apr 11 16:50:08 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* gtk.scm: Do not dispatch gtk events if the server is grabbed.
	(Uses new `X-server-grabs' primitive)

Sat Apr 10 17:06:19 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* hover-focus.scm: Fixed the : -> #: in the define-scwm-option,
	and added the define of the hover-focus-window variable.  Also
	make hover-focus windows default to 'click focus style, and revert
	when hover-focus is turned off on them.  Added exported
	`uninstall-hover-focus' proc, too.

	* base.scm: Added fg, bg, font keyword args to menuitem proc, and
	set them using new setters.

	* style.scm: Change default-style-condition-handler from
	window-match?? to resource-match?? as matching on titles really is
	the wrong behaviour (and I finally got annoyed enough by this
	because an xterm started up sticky w/ nofocus just because the
	last program I started in it was an "xload" [I make my xterm title
	display the last program it was running for more than 5 seconds]).

1999-04-09  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* prompt-color.scm (prompt-color-hbox): Initialize the color
	selection dialog with the current color.

	* preferences.scm (scwm-options-notebook-page): Removed the help
	buttons. Instead put tooltips on everything and its children.

	* style.scm: Made #:no-titlebar a hint style option.
	New styles: #:highlight-{bg,fg,foreground,background}.

	* prompt-font.scm (prompt-font): prompt-font-hbox was called
	incorrectly.

Fri Apr  9 11:31:24 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* prefs-menu.scm: Update some proc names in a comment.

	* base.scm: Rename set-menu-* to set-default-menu-*, and use the
	new names.

Fri Apr  9 11:04:27 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Renamed set-menu-* to set-default-menu-*.  Use new
	names, set-menu-look! and set-menu-title! instead of
	set-menu-menu-look!, etc.

Sun Apr  4 01:24:34 1999  Carl R. Witty  <cwitty@newtonlabs.com>

	* prompt-color.scm (prompt-color-hbox): Fix cut-and-paste bug.

Thu Apr  8 09:00:23 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* gtk.scm: Use name `gdk-get-leader-window-id' for the proc that I
	hacked into gdk that I called `gdk-lead-window'.  guile-gtk-0.16
	will have the new proc with its longer name (and also the needed
	bug fixes)

1999-04-07  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* Makefile.am (scwm_gtk_scheme): Some scm .files were omitted.

Wed Apr  7 17:27:53 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winlist.scm: Added Ken Pizzini's warp-placement feature.  Use
	the 'warp-placement property of a window (a list of two elements)
	to control where the pointer gets warped to when a window is
	selected.

Wed Apr  7 08:03:15 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* prompt-proc.scm: ws change.

	* gnome-hints.scm: use-module (app scwm animation) to fix bug Sam
	Steingold reported.

	* animation.scm: Added a comment

Wed Apr  7 07:54:53 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winlist.scm (show-window-list-menu): Permit hover-delay and
	popup-delay arguments and pass them along.  Fix bug in passing of
	warp-to-first (it was going to the menu proc, not to the
	popup-menu proc due to a misplaced paren).

	* flux.scm: Give a hover-delay of 0 to
	select-window-from-window-list so that the window gets highlighted
	right away.

	* base.scm (menu): Be sure popup-delay and hover-delay are both
	bound and not #f before using them.

Tue Apr  6 12:39:55 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* *.scm: Replace hilight with highlight.

Tue Apr  6 11:13:40 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Fix typo.

Mon Apr  5 15:43:05 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Updated for additions of .scm files below.

Mon Apr  5 15:21:19 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* prompt-string.scm: Rename prompt-proc-hbox to
	simple-prompt-proc-hbox so as to not conflict with the real
	prompt-proc-hbox.

	* prompt-proc.scm: Added.  Requires some bug-fixes to
	guile-gtk-0.15 to not seg fault.

	* rgb-database.scm: Added.

	* preferences.scm: Try attaching tooltips to the hbox-es, but it
	doesn't work on hboxes for me.  To what can they be attached?

	* message-window.scm:  Added opts: *message-window-{fg,bg}-color*

	* gtk.scm: Added missing use-module of (app scwm optargs).

	* base.scm: Make menu color setters call make-color as
	needed. Make background-system a public proc.

	* auto-raise.scm: Move option to end after the window-style exists
	so that the call to the setter when define-scwm-option expands
	doesn't error.

	* prompt-file.scm, prompt-color.scm: Moved the gtk-entry-set-text
 	to after the gtk-combo-set-popdown-strings since it otherwise
 	seemed to get set to the first popdown string.

	* sort.scm: Reverse the order that the comparator is used so that
	it sorts in the same order as the primitive sort in guile-1.3+.

Mon Apr  5 09:50:42 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Drop user-options.scm -- that file was removed.

Fri Apr  2 15:39:12 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* gtk.scm: Added gdk-leader-window variable and set it if
	gdk-lead-window proc exists (that proc is in a patch to
	guile-gtk-0.15).  Used by scwm destroy-window primitive to avoid
	having scwm destroy one of its own gtk/gdk windows.

Fri Apr  2 15:35:58 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* preferences.scm: Adde use-modules of (app scwm sort) since sort
	primitive was added in guile-1.4.

Thu Apr  1 19:14:14 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Added *menu-font*, *menu-text-color*, *menu-bg-color*
	options.

	* preferences.scm: Handle 'color, 'font, 'file better.  Reverse
	order of sorting groups so it is forward alphabetical.

	* message-window.scm: Added *message-window-font* as an option

	* face.scm: Added *window-font* as an option.

	* defoption.scm: Improve re-load behaviour -- do not reset
	scwm-options list.  Improve docs on define-scwm-option.  Added
	permit-disable, layout-hint properties.  Require a docstring and a
	type.  Make `optget' a synonmym for scwm-option-get.

	* prompt-color.scm, prompt-font.scm, prompt-file.scm: Added, for
	prompting for the various things using gtk.

Thu Apr  1 10:21:55 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* prompt-string.scm: Added prompt-proc-hbox, for prompting for a
	procedure name (as a string, for now, though a cool procedure
	selector/definer dialog would be so totally great that I might
	have to write it!)

	* auto-raise.scm, primopts.scm: Move *auto-raise* option into the
 	auto-raise.scm module (it was here only for testing/demonstration
 	of a boolean).  Make default-auto-raise-{focus,unfocus}-proc options.

	* preferences.scm: Handle type 'proc using new prompt-proc-hbox.

	* fvwm-module.scm: Make *fvwm2-module-path*, *debug-fvwm-module*
	option variables.

Thu Apr  1 08:58:21 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* prompt-range.scm: Handle digits properly, make the adjust widget
	use better arguments (gnome-desktop-number was coming up with a
	slider from 1 to 5 only, instead of 1 to 10).

Wed Mar 31 17:27:30 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* prompt-range.scm: Set size of scale to 300 wide, do not fill or
	expand the scale, and do not expand the label

	* primopts.scm: Change *auto-raise* to 'focus group, not
	'focus-behaviour.

	* preferences.scm: Use a GtkNotebook widget, sort based on types,
	improve layout a lot.  Pretty usable now.

	* menus-extras.scm: Make split-list-by-group public, and second
	arg optional for initial condition.

	* flux.scm: Added move-all-windows-relative.

	* defoption.scm: Added note about some new types ('command,
	'percent-or-on-off) [not yet support specially, but worth
	distinguishing].

	* base.scm: Use define-scwm-option, instead of **VAR.  Drop
	scwm-user-var, use *foo* option names.  Added move-window-relative.

	* hover-focus.scm, gnome-hints.scm, flux.scm, auto-raise.scm: Use
 	define-scwm-option instead of **VAR

	* winops.scm: Use defoption, rename each option foo to *foo*.  Fix
	bug in default-move-opaquely? (was using opaque-resize-percent).
	Define *foo*'s as scwm options.

1999-03-30  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* group.scm (deiconify-group): Would call a nonexistent function.

Tue Mar 30 20:23:37 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Added edge-ops.scm

	* edge-ops.scm: Contributed by Sam Falkner;  I fixed his 'east <->
	'west hack since that bug has been corrected in the C code. Thanks
	Sam!

Tue Mar 30 19:02:20 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Added hash-table->alist (should be a guile proc, so I
	put it here)

1999-03-29  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* style.scm (window-unstyle): New function, opposite of
	`window-style'.

Mon Mar 29 20:55:39 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Added install of ScwmBiff.scm, time-convert.scm

Mon Mar 29 14:43:07 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* preferences.scm: Added help buttons to show documentation in a
	message-window.  This could instead use a gtk window of some
	sort.  Also added some broken code to try to support tooltips, but
	I don't have docs to help figure this out.

	* message-window.scm: provide scwm-message-window. Added comments
 	on public functions.

	* flux.scm: Added comments, make unflash-window more robust.

	* file.scm: Added doc comments.

	* defoption.scm: ws, add doc comment for define-scwm-option-proc.

	* base.scm: ws.

Mon Mar 29 10:39:46 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* prompt-range.scm: Use optional digits argument, and set to 0 for
	prompt-integer-range.

	* primopts.scm:  Added `*edge-scroll-delay*',
	`*edge-move-threshold*', use time-convert module.

	* preferences.scm: Simplify prompt for the dialog to just the name
	of the option (i.e., drop "Set " prefix)

	* time-convert.scm, flux.scm: Added, moved ms->usec, sec->usec
 	from flux.

	* ScwmClock.scm: use time-convert.scm

Mon Mar 29 09:28:34 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* prompt-string.scm: Added prompt-path-hbox, and use-module (app
	scwm file) for it.

	* prompt-range.scm: Added prompt-integer-range-hbox.

	* preferences.scm: Clean up option-widget-and-getter -- make it
	use the new *-hbox procs. Do `scwm-options-dialog' right, with
	apply button, and make ok/apply take effect.  Works for me now!

	* file.scm:  Fix bug in (path-list->string-with-colons '()).

Mon Mar 29 08:10:12 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ScwmBiff.scm: Added, from Glenn Trigg.

	* simplebiff.scm: New version from Glenn Trigg -- added
	activate-proc, deactivate-proc keyword arguments, and return a
	lambda to remove the hook.  This version is required for his first
	version of ScwmBiff.

Sun Mar 28 20:05:38 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* preferences.scm, prompt-bool.scm, prompt-range.scm,
 	prompt-string.scm: lots of changes to use key args, to separate
	building of widget from building of top level.  Now have
	`scwm-options-dialog' proc  -- still incomplete as I don't invoke
	the setters yet, but I'm outta time.

Sun Mar 28 16:37:12 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Added missing .scm files to the install list.
	Added a "check:" target that diffs *.scm and the listed files so
	that it's easy to keep this file in synch with the directory
	contents.

Sun Mar 28 16:36:27 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* primopts.scm: Check for feature scwm-auto-raise, not just
	auto-raise, as the feature namespace is shared across the whole
	system.

Sun Mar 28 16:13:12 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux-vars.scm: Removed-- replaced by preferences stuff.

	* prefs-menu.scm: Ws change.

	* fvwm-module.scm: Use path-list->string-with-colons instead of
	insert-colons and list->string.

	* flux.scm: use-module message-window, + added comment re:
	sans-final-newline.

	* file.scm: Added path-list->string-with-colons,
	string-with-colons->path-list.  Use (ice-9 string-fun) for
	separate-fields-discarding-char for latter.

	* doc.scm: Make doc-files public.

	* base.scm: Added pix->%x, pix->%y (inverses of %x, %y)

	* auto-raise: provide 'scwm-auto-raise for testing whether the
	module is loaded.

	* themes.scm, theme-impl.scm: Rename theme-path to *theme-path* and use a
	define-scwm-option macro to define it.

Sat Mar 27 20:38:04 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* defoption.scm: Added. A pretty complete `define-scwm-option'
	implementation.  It might need revising for scheme style, and has
	lots of potential for further improvements, but is already pretty
	useful. Partially inspired by Emacs's customize.

	* preferences.scm: `gui-set', `option-menu', `popup-option-menu',
	ans `scwm-options-menu'.  Mostly replaces the functionality in
	prefs-menu module, but does it using the information gleaned from
	define-scwm-option invocations of loaded modules.

	* primopts.scm: Added a handful of `define-scwm-option' calls for
	options that are managed by primitives and not real variables.
	Also added for a test boolean flag.  (A test string option is in
	themes.scm)

	* prompt-bool.scm, prompt-range.scm: Added.

	* prompt-string.scm: Added -- renamed from string-prompt.scm for
	consistency and a better prefix.  Also made the entry box size
	itself a bit better, and removed the homogeneous flag from the
	hbox container so that the prompt doesn't get bigger when resizing.

Fri Mar 26 11:09:25 1999  Maciej Stachowiak  (mstachow@racerx)

        * style.scm (#:squashed-titlebar): Fix typo.

Fri Mar 26 15:38:00 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* message-window.scm: Added `message-window-copy-style!' and
	`make-message-window-clone-default'

	* flux.scm: Use make-message-window-clone-default for
	display-message-briefly's message window.

Thu Mar 25 17:44:09 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* style.scm: Added #:squashed-titlebar, #:no-side-decorations as
	full-fledged boolean-options.  They're still not laid out ideally,
	but now they take effect immediately using new
	`force-reset-window-frame!' primitive.

	* base.scm: Added #:submenu option to menuitem to force the
	menu-item to be treated as a sub-menu;  use #:submenu instead of
	#:action when you've got a submenu -- see gjb.scwmrc's
	menu-global-theme example.  Fix bug in
	`scwm-is-constraint-enabled?'  Added #:popup-delay and
	#:hover-delay options to `menu' constructor (they use new
	set-menu-popup-delay! and set-menu-hover-delay!)

Thu Mar 25 12:38:10 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* snap.scm: Added, from Danius Michaelides

	* style.scm: Lame doc for window-style.

	* menus-extras.scm: Make sorted-by-car-string public, since it is
	used by winlist.scm

	* ScwmButtons.scm: Use #!, !# style comments for some sample code.

1999-03-23  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* wininfo.scm (wildcard->regexp): Would not treat escaped * and ?
	correctly.

1999-03-23  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@alum.mit.edu>

	* tile.scm (tile): Pass #:raise option rather than #:restack to
	tile-windows.

Wed Mar 24 19:18:54 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* themes.scm: Rename force to force? for style and so I don't hide
	`force'

Wed Mar 24 19:02:21 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* std-menus.scm: Make menu-window-theme menu-global-theme
	functions, with force? optarg for defeating caching.

Wed Mar 24 18:53:51 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* listops.scm: Fix bug in there-exists? -- thanks to Glenn Trigg
	for patch.

	* themes.scm: Added load-cached-theme.  Also added theme-names, by
	Glenn Trigg and it now uses listops.

	* std-menus.scm: Added menu-window-theme andd menu-global-theme,
	from Glenn Trigg, now uses style, themes.

Wed Mar 24 15:34:48 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Drop with-window-no-wind -- bug is gone so this is
	superfluous.

Wed Mar 24 11:57:57 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Use the other fix for the below problem -- use
	scwm-user-var when referencing move-opaquely? and resize-opaquely?
	from the winops module.  User variables need standardization.

Wed Mar 24 09:54:32 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Move move-opaquely? and resize-opaquely? into the
	root module, and use default-move-opaquely? and
	default-resize-opaquely? if the respective predicate is #f.  This
	fixes the bug whereby redefining the testing predicates doesn't
	work because they were in the winops module (Sam Steingold
	reported this.)

Tue Mar 23 15:47:05 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux-gtk.scm: Added -- flux procs that require gtk module.

	* flux.scm: Move rename-window-interactively to new flux-gtk so
 	that flux doesn't require gtk (in case gtk is broken or
 	non-existent for a user).

1999-03-22  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* group.scm: New file, containing window group operations.
	* test/group.scm: New file, tests for the above.
	* flux.scm: Removed `group-leader-id' and `group->windows', since
	group.scm provides them.
	* Makefile.am: group.scm added.

Mon Mar 22 18:58:16 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Move reset-hook! to be in the root module.

Mon Mar 22 16:39:06 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm, prefs-menu.scm: Make `default-move-opaquely?' and
 	`default-resize-opaquely?' always return
 	opaque-move-percent/opaque-resize-percent if they are boolean.
  	Make opaque-move-menu uses #t for All, #f for Never.  Added
 	`opaque-resize-menu'.

	* flux.scm: Improve `first-word' to stop at tabs, too.  Added
	`netscape-goto-url' and rework `netscape-goto-cut-buffer-url' to
	use it.

	* doc.scm: Put doc-files definition before the define-module so
	it goes in the root module.

	* winops.scm, style.scm, prefs-menu.scm, minimal.scm,
 	fvwm-compat.scm. flux.scm, doc-files.scm, base.scm: Clean up some FIXGJB
 	comments, switch to new format.

Mon Mar 22 13:44:35 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Only add reset-hook! if it's not defined (guile >1.3
	has C-based hooks with reset-hook! defined.

	* flux.scm: Added `group-leader-id' and `group->windows'.

	* fvwm-compat.scm: Added %x-permit-negative and %y-permit-negative
	(maybe should be default behaviour for %x and %y.

Thu Mar 18 12:04:40 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm, style.scm, bincomm.scm: Fixed some indentation/ws
 	issues that M-x unbalenced-parent complains about.

Thu Mar 18 08:09:30 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* wininfo.scm: Make rectangle-overlap? and intersection-area public

Wed Mar 17 19:19:55 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* menus-extras.scm, Makefile.am: Fixed missing dependence on (app
 	scwm base), and install this file.

Wed Mar 17 18:32:13 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints.scm, simple-constraints.scm,
 	ui-constraints-toggle-menu.scm: Added commented-out use-module of
 	(cassowary-constraints) -- it's built in to --with-cassowary
 	configured scwms still, but might not be later.

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Needs (app scwm optargs)

	* base.scm: Fix select-window to use define*-public.

Wed Mar 17 12:50:02 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* constraints.scm: Cleaned up a bit, added `start-constraints'.

	* base.scm: Added `select-window' written in terms of
	`select-viewport-position' primitive (which used to be the
	select-window primitive).

Wed Mar 17 12:04:47 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* constraints.scm: Added `end-constraints' to stop using the
	solver.

Wed Mar 17 11:54:04 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints.scm, ui-constraints-buttons.scm: Fiddle w/
 	comments to provide some more useful s-exp for interactive
 	evaluation.

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Make cnctr-keep-top-at-value,
	cnctr-keep-left-at-value, cnctr-keep-right-at-value to all table
	option enable? arguments, and honour them.

	* simple-constraints.scm:  Don't define solver in here, do it in
	constraints.scm. Fixed missing test of enable? before adding
	constraint in keep-tops-even.  Use (scwm-master-solver)
	throughout, instead of "solver"

	* constraints.scm:  Added `reset-scwm-constraints' and call it.
	Perhaps I should add a menu item to gjb.scwmrc to reset the
	constraint solver.

Fri Mar 12 19:49:51 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* string-prompt.scm: Use dialog style instead of toplevel.  Set
	the position of the window based on pointer position (still not
	right, though).

	* prefs-menu.scm: Minor changes to docs, some actiosn.

	* flux.scm: Added rename-window-interactively (use string-prompt
	because of this).  Added read-until-eof, output-of-system-cmd,
	chop-newline.  Still need some asynchronous execution of scheme
	command on the output of a system cmd.

Fri Mar 12 17:12:05 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* menus-extras.scm: Added -- moved fold-menu-list and split-list
	out from base.scm, added fold-menu-list-by-group and
	split-by-resource.

	* winlist.scm: Added by-resource option to show-window-list-menu,
	and rework that proc a lot.  Instead of using fold-menu-list, use
	split-by-resource if the menu would be too tall (as checked by new
	menu-max-fold-lines proc.  Use the menus-extras module to get at
	the new functionality

	* std-menus.scm: Use menus-extras module to get at fold-menu-list

	* flux.scm: Run .xclients in the background (added "&")

	* base.scm: Move fold-menu-list and split-list out into
	menus-extras module.

Wed Mar 10 20:20:08 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Added `run-dot-xclients-at-startup', `run-dot-xclients-script'

Wed Mar 10 19:59:00 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winlist.scm: fold-menu-list of the window-list in case it gets
	too long.  Thanks to Warwick Harvey for the bug report!

1999-03-01  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@alum.mit.edu>

	* bincomm.scm: Fixed remaining obvious 64-bit bugs. Probably more
	remain.

	* fvwm-module.scm: Send auxiliary config info like fvwm
	does. Patch from Danius Michaelides.

1999-02-27  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

        * Makefile.am: Added hover-focus.scm to the scwm_common_scheme
        installation list.

        * hover-focus.scm: New module to automatically focus a
        click-to-focus window when the mouse hovers over it for a while.

1999-02-16  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@alum.mit.edu>

	* optargs.scm (lambda*): Handle empty argument lists properly.

1999-02-13  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@alum.mit.edu>

	* base.scm (popup-menu-from-decoration): Moved here from
	flux.scm. Changed to align the menu exactly to the button rather
	than to the window (which looked kind of weird). Also, always left
	align.
	* flux.scm: Removed `popup-menu-from-decoration'.

1999-02-11  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@alum.mit.edu>

	* animated-iconify.scm: Added missing close paren.

	* animated-iconify.scm: Added `animated-toggle-iconify'

	* animated-iconify.scm: Make `animated-iconify',
	`animated-deiconify' and `animated-deiconify-to-current-viewport'
	animate from the window size and position to the icon size and
	position, instead of the previous behavior.

	* fvwm-module.scm: Enhance error output on a communication error.

	* bincomm.scm: Fix some obvious problems with 64-bit
	versions. Patch from Janne Sinkkonen
	<janne@avocado.pc.helsinki.fi>.

	* animation.scm: Export `animated-resize-window',
	`animated-resize-frame' and `animation-delay'.

1999-02-10  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Set the xlib-drawing-mask so that
	the drawing is visible on a 32 bit display.  Change names--
	e.g., keep-top-at-value -> anchor-top.  Also update pixmap names
	for the anchor constraints

1999-02-09  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@alum.mit.edu>

	* gnome-hints.scm: Expanded documentation and added optional
	debugging code.

1999-02-09  Sam Steingold  <sds@goems.com>

	* gnome-hints.scm: new user variable - `gnome-desktop-number'.
	Use it in `enable-gnome-hints'.
	new user variable - `gnome-shade-animated'.  Use it in
	`gnome-update-state'.
	Do not enable gnome hints by default, wait for the user to set the
	user options.

1999-02-08  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@alum.mit.edu>

	* gnome-hints.scm: Enable by default when loading module.

	* gnome-hints.scm: Fully support _WIN_STATE, _WIN_LAYER and
	_WIN_WORKSPACE including notification of internal state. Remove
	debugging statements. Gnome hint support should now be complete,
	with the following caveats: (1) separate vertical and horizontal
	maximization are not really properly supported; nothing really
	uses this AFAIK so it doesn't matter much; (2) layers are hacked
	by pretending layer <= 4 is one layer, and layer =>5 is another;
	and (3) dock-layer windows are not avoided when
	maximizing. Rewrites of the maximize code and a layer
	implementation should fix this.

	* winops.scm: Use window-properties instead of object-properties
	for maximized state, so useful notification can happen.

1999-02-08  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@alum.mit.edu>

	* virtual.scm (move-to-viewport): Typo fixed. Patch from Sam
	Falkner <samf@Central.Sun.COM>.

	* gnome-hints.scm: Fully support _WIN_AREA and _WIN_AREA_COUNT.

	* flux.scm: Account for module name changes.

	* Makefile.am (scwm_common_scheme): Update file list.

	* gnome-hints.scm: Added support for nearly all gnome
	hints. _WIN_AREA_COUNT, _WIN_AREA, _WIN_STATE and _WIN_LAYER still
	do not update properly in response to internal state changes, but
	other than that, everything should work.

	* kde-hints.scm: Minor bugfixes: use `window-close-hook' rather
	than `X-DestroyNotify hook', since windows may be closed without
	being destroyed. Make `client-message-hook' expect a window as its
	first argument. (Untested - I don't have KDE installed)

1999-02-08  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@alum.mit.edu>

	* kde-hints.scm: Renamed from kwm-emulation.scm
	* animated-iconify.scm: Renamed from animate-iconify-window.scm
	* path-cache.scm: Renamed from cached-program-exists.scm

1999-02-04  Sam Steingold  <sds@goems.com>

	* placement.scm: remove `peek'.

Sun Jan 31 13:13:35 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Fix drawing of keep-to-left-of now
	that windows are kept in their original order in the ui-constraint
	objects.

1999-01-30  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@alum.mit.edu>

	* gnome-hints.scm: Preliminary version of gnome hints
	support. Only the client list, workspace and hints properties are
	supported for now, expect the rest soon (layers will be faked by
	making windows past some layer threshold kept-on-top until there
	is real layer support in scwm).

1999-01-29  Jeff Nichols  <jwnichls@cs.washington.edu>

	* simple-constraints.scm: Folded "v" into the v-related function

	* window-locations.scm: Use (app scwm base), made return viewport
	positions instead of virtual positons

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Added new menuname-as-class-name,
	updated drawing procs, added some new constraint classes, some
	abstractions for drawing

	* ui-constraints-toggle-menu.scm: Use new menuname proc

	* ui-constraints.scm: Lowercase var names, change draw proc
	arguments, added menuname proc to ctr, use vector not lists

Fri Jan 29 09:34:58 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am (scwm_common_scheme): Regenerate the
	scwm_common_scheme variable automatically since it was way out of
	synch w/ the existing files list.  (Are the long lines a big
	problem for anyone?  or for Automake?)


1999-01-29  Sam Steingold  <sds@goems.com>

	* Makefile.am: install animate-iconify-window.scm.

Tue Jan 26 15:58:08 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* string-prompt.scm: Pack the prompt label in with expand set to
	false so only the entry widget expands when resized.

	* simple-constraints.scm: Added synopsis doc comments, declare
	variable v.

	* fvwm-module.scm: Make fvwm2-module-send-window-list private (I
	had made it public for debugging reasons long ago when I was more
	clueless about the module system).

1999-01-26  Sam Steingold  <sds@goems.com>

	* placement.scm (place-at-point-internal): call
	`move-inside-current-viewport'.

Mon Jan 25 17:35:13 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* message-window.scm: Fix `resize-message-new-size-hook' to take
	all the extra arguments I just added so the window can report in
	client units and pixel positions as well.

Mon Jan 25 16:55:02 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* animate-iconify-window.scm: Added
	animate-deiconify-to-current-viewport, wrote
	animate-iconify-or-deiconify in terms of a win-pos and win-size,
	not an explicit window---this better supports
	animate-deiconify-to-current-viewport.

	* virtual.scm: Added current-viewport-offset-xx,
	current-viewport-offset-yy, window-position-in-viewport, and
	deiconify-to-current-viewport

Sat Jan 23 17:43:35 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* animate-iconify-window.scm: Added.  Still issues remaining with
 	deiconify and viewports/desks.

Sat Jan 23 14:33:10 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Added MESSAGE-WINDOW argument to
	`select-window-interactively' to permit re-using an existing
	message window when prompting.

	* window-locations.scm: Have all the procs return point pairs, (X
	. Y) instead of lists of points.

	* ui-constraints-toggle-menu.scm: Flash the constrainted windows
	in addition to drawing the constraint representation.  Added
	"Enable all" and "Disable all" menu options.

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Cleaned up a lot -- use
	ui-constraint-prompter-msgwin and make it more obvious by
	default.  Use new versions of xlib-* procedures, and use
	two-window-prompter to factor out some commonality in prompting
	procedures.

	* ui-constraints-buttons.scm: Try to reduce the amount of extra
	padding in the button bar.  May illustrate a bug in Scwm's
	handling of no title bar.

	* ui-constraints.scm: Added `enable-all-constraints'.

	* message-window.scm: Bugfix -- interactive-move's were not
	displaying the message-window because
	msgwin-{enabler,disabler}-table had a cut & paste error.

	* gtk.scm: Added comment for scwm-gtk-sync.

	* flux.scm: Added proc-when-selected argument to
	`select-multiple-windows-interactively'.  Wrote
	`delete-multiple-windows-interactively'.

	* doc.scm: Make documentation-debug #f by default.

Sat Jan 23 10:49:43 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* constraints.scm: Use ui-constraints-toggle-menu, and bind it to C-M-S-c

	* ui-constraints-toggle-menu.scm: Added

Fri Jan 22 17:58:26 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* constraints.scm: Drop the window-style, since it used something
	from my .scwmrc

	* gtk.scm: Fix bug in `gtk-pixmap-new-search-scwm-path'

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Added keep-to-left-of, use
	indicative pixmaps

Fri Jan 22 17:14:44 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* constraints.scm: Added -- top level module for constraint
	support in Scwm

Fri Jan 22 16:29:45 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* gtk.scm: Added `gtk-pixmap-new-search-scwm-path' for finding
	pixmaps in image-load-path

	* window-locations.scm: Define `half' that does truncation and use
	it instead of dividing by 2 so we don't get floating point
	numbers.  Use `window-frame-size' not `window-size' (get values in
	pixels)

	* ui-constraints.scm: Added pixmap-name argument to
	make-ui-constraint-class, use it.  Drop draw-loop -- use map.
	Added `disable-all-constraints'.  Fix bug in diable-ui-constraint

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Added keep-above, fix drawing code
	to use window-locations module

	* ui-constraints-buttons.scm: Added tool-tips and pixmaps.

Fri Jan 22 16:17:14 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* modifier-key-bindings.scm: Added -- from scheme/tests/keycode.scm

Fri Jan 22 08:49:05 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints.scm: Use simple-constraints module, and refer to
	the solver using the new `scwm-master-solver' accessor instead of
	the variable `solver' from simple-constraints.scm

Fri Jan 22 08:43:51 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window-locations.scm, ui-constraints-classes.scm,
	ui-constraints-buttons.scm, simple-constraints.scm: Added

Thu Jan 21 12:05:10 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm (default-resize-opaquely, default-move-opaquely): Use
	<= for the test so 100% means full-size windows will work
	opaquely. Thanks Eli Barzilay!

Thu Jan 21 12:02:28 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* kwm-emulation.scm: Use X-PropertyNotify-hook to catch changes in
	KWM_WIN_ICONIFIED and honour them -- this makes the middle-button
	clicking on the task bar work.  Fix bug in initialization in
	SETTING of CURRENT_DESKTOP.  Remove kwm-kpanel-winid var, and
	rename kwm-module-windows to kwm-module-winids.  Fix -reset
	routine to remove the property hook handlers.

Wed Jan 20 16:53:01 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints.scm: Use error more pervasively.  Rename
	ui-constraint-enable to ui-constraint-enabled?. Use vectors of
	characters as obids (not strings). Make UI-CTR semantics be that
	it only returns the list of args for the real ctr.  Implement
	make-ui-constraint-interactively in terms of make-ui-constraint.
	Fix the returned constraint instance objects to have the enabled
	flag, the constraint-class object, etc., and update accessors to
	go to the right places.  Rewrote ui-constraint-windows to use
	cl-windows-of-constraint instead of building the window list into
	the ui-constraint instances (in case some of the arguments are not
	windows... I suppose we could put a real list of windows in the
	ui-constraint object using `window?').

Wed Jan 20 14:23:09 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints.scm: Bug fixes.  Use "error" instead of returning
	#f when wrong type argument; use set! to side-effect global --
	cons is side effect free; simplify ui-constraint? and
	ui-constraint-class? predicates -- use pair? not list?.
	Documentation still needs to be inside the procedures,
	ui-constraint-class still is wrong because the ui-constraint
	objects do not refer to their ui-constraint-class objects.

Wed Jan 20 13:23:23 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints.scm: Use delq, not remove-from-list, fix some
	typos, begin adding some documentation, begin using (error ..)
	instead of returning #f when accessors are called w/ wrong
	objects, etc.

Wed Jan 20 10:37:42 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints.scm: Added

	* kwm-emulation.scm: Some general clean up, try to handle
	window-list better, and try handling iconifications.

Mon Jan 18 15:33:41 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* string-prompt.scm: Added to provide string-prompting
	capabilities.  Still could use work, but is already useful in a
	limited way.

Mon Jan 18 13:44:32 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Fixed select-window-interactively-- it was badly
	broken from the message window rewrites

Sat Jan  9 11:27:10 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* animation.scm: Fix some of the example animated-move-to calls;
	'x, 'y are no longer valid -- uses #f instead to mean "no change"

Sun Dec 27 14:48:35 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* placement.scm: Several useful procedures that place windows
 	(place-in-viewport, place-on-desk, interactive-place,
 	place-at-point) and several that return placement procedures
 	according to various parameters (in-viewport-placement,
 	on-desk-placement, interactive-placement, at-point-placement,
 	virtual-switch-placement)

	* virtual.scm: Various useful things for viewport/desktop
 	management. Procedures to compute useful aligned/integral viewport
 	coordinates (containing-aligned-viewport,
 	nearest-aligned-viewport, window-aligned-viewport win); useful
 	functions for moving windows around relative to virtual space
	(move-window-to-viewport, move-inside-viewport,
 	move-inside-aligned-viewport, move-inside-current-viewport,
 	move-inside-own-viewport); procedures to set the current viewport
 	position in interesting higher-level ways (move-to-viewport,
 	align-viewport, warp-to-window-viewport); and a macro that saves
 	and restores teh current desktop and viewport
 	(save-virtual-excursion).

	* flux.scm (move-window-to-viewport, in-viewport, place-at-point,
 	move-inside): Removed; virtual.scm and placement.scm have more
 	general replacements (roughly bases on these).

	* base.scm (round/): New procedure that divides one number by
 	another and returns the nearest integer, useful to implement
 	percentages and integer division for coordinates. All the
 	%-procedures have been converted to use round/.

	* wininfo.scm (window-center-position): New procedure that returns
 	a list of the coordinates

1998-12-23  Sam Steingold  <sds@goems.com>

	* Makefile.am (scwm_common_scheme): reokaced
	move-resize-message-window.scm, move-with-message-window.scm,
	resize-with-message-window.scm,
	standard-move-resize-message-window.scm, with message-window.scm.
	(apparently Maciej forgot to check in Makefile.am).

Tue Dec 22 04:05:39 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* message-window.scm: Consolidate message window stuff. Added
 	`message-window-options' to allow enabling and disabling of
 	various message windows and customization of positioning/tracking
 	behavior, and `message-window-style' to provide the familiar
 	interface for setting the appearance of a message window.
	* resize-with-message-window.scm, move-resize-message-window.scm,
 	standard-move-resize-message-window.scm,
 	move-with-message-window.scm: Removed (obsoleted by
 	message-window.scm)
	* Makefile.am: install and distribute message-window.scm, do not
 	install or distribute resize-with-message-window.scm,
 	move-resize-message-window.scm,
 	standard-move-resize-message-window.scm,
 	move-with-message-window.scm.

1998-12-21  Todd Larason  <jtl@molehill.org>

	* desk-background.scm: simplification: fallback to default only if
	nothing is set for a desk, not for each component separately.
	This leads to both simpler code and more consistent/understandable
	behavior.

Sat Dec 19 02:42:52 1998  Carl R. Witty  <cwitty@newtonlabs.com>

	* wininfo.scm (title-match??, class-match??, resource-match??,
 	icon-title-match??, client-hostname-match??): Typo fix in doc.

1998-12-15  Todd Larason  <jtl@molehill.org>

	* Makefile.am (scwm_common_scheme): install message window files

	* desk-background.scm: use-module (app scwm optargs)

Sat Dec 12 00:15:14 1998  Carl R. Witty  <cwitty@newtonlabs.com>

	* winlist.scm (list-windows): Update doc.
	(winlist-skip?): Typo fix in doc.
	(show-window-list-menu): Update doc.

	* std-menus.scm (xlock-options): Made xlock very nice, instead of
	very greedy.

	(raise-window-above): Fix bug.

	* listops.scm (filter): Typo fix in doc.

	* flux.scm (make-file-menu): Changed default editor to emacs.
	(bool->str): Update doc.
	(find-window-by): New function.
	(find-window-by-name, find-window-by-class-resource): Rewritten to
 	use find-window-by.
	(use-change-desk-commands): Don't error if the vector isn't
	long enough.

	* base.scm (hotkeys-from-name): Don't error if the last letter
	is an '&'.

	* wininfo.scm (window-geometry-string): Update doc.
	(window-overlaps-window?): Update doc.

	* winops.scm (window-frame-area): Rewrite doc.

	* wininfo.scm (wildcard->regexp): Rewrite doc.
	(wildcard-matcher, wildcard-match?): Update docs.
	(client-hostname-match??): Typo fix.

	* prefs-menu.scm (user-option-menuitem): Made non-public.

	* flux.scm (use-change-desk-commands): Rewrite doc.

	* face.scm (title-style, border-style, button-style): Update docs.

	* winlist.scm (should-circulate-skip?): Typo fix in doc.

	* cached-program-exists.scm (cached-program-exists?): Update doc.

	* doc.scm (documentation): Update doc.

1998-12-13  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* tests/session.scm: New file for SM tests.

1998-12-09  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* flux.scm (take-screenshot): New function.

1998-12-06  Todd Larason  <jtl@molehill.org>

	* desk-background.scm: initial implementation of a high-level
	interface for setting desktop backgrounds.

Sat Dec  5 12:26:47 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Fixed bugs in previous checkin's display-message-briefly

Sat Dec  5 12:05:31 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Added back in the menu-* variables to avoid order
	dependency in initialization;  added select-window-interactively
	to mimic the old primitive by the same name -- uses message window
	SMOBs now.

	* flux.scm: Rewrite display-message-briefly to use message-window
	SMOBs, add gravity->alignments proc since it's more generally useful

	* move-resize-message-window.scm, move-with-message-window.scm,
	resize-with-message-window.scm,
	standard-move-resize-message-window.scm:  Added -- by Jeff
	W. Nichols.  Supports previously-built-in support for message
	window display of move position and resize size during interactive
	moves and resizes.

1998-12-04  Todd Larason  <jtl@molehill.org>

	* animation.scm: doc update

	* base.scm: minor doc updates

	* cached-program-exists.scm: doc updates

	* doc.scm: doc update

	* face.scm: minor doc updates

	* flux.scm: documentation fixes

	* fvwm-eval.scm: documentation for eval-fvwm-command

	* fvwm-module.scm (end-window-list): no longer public

	* image-loaders.scm: documentation for image-loader functions

	* listops.scm: fix documentation of and-map and or-map to match
	actual funcationality

	* module-types.scm: fix typo in defintion of M_DEWINDOWSHADE

	* prefs-menu.scm: doc update

	* stacking.scm: "nitpicking" doc fixes

	* std-menus.scm: typo fix and doc clarification

	* style.scm: doc updates, with some minor code rearrangement

	* theme-impl.scm: initial documentation

	* themes.scm: initial documentation

	* wininfo.scm: minor doc updates

	* winlist.scm (list-windows): workaround for scwmdoc bug

	* winops.scm: doc update

	All of the above are from Carl R. Witty <cwitty@newtonlabs.com>
	Thanks much!

1998-12-04  Sam Steingold  <sds@goems.com>

	* doc.scm (documentation): cleaned up.
	(doc-files): added more files.

Thu Dec  3 10:28:26 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* doc.scm, base.scm: Make no attempt to define user-settable
 	variables in the root module. That was only ever needed for
 	variables that the C code (brokenly) looked up with gh_lookup,
 	which we are not doing for any of the affected vars.

	* flux.scm: Replace uses of interactive-resize-maybe-opaque and
 	interactive-move-maybe-opaque with interactive-move and
 	interactive-resize respectively.

	* winops.scm: Replace interactive-resize-maybe-opaque and
 	interactive-move-maybe-opaque with interactive-move and
 	interactive-resize which take a optional boolean `opaquely?'
  	argument which defaults to the result of calling `move-opaquely?'
  	or `resize-opaquely?' on the argument. The former definitions of
 	those two predicates have been prefixed with `default-' and the
 	original names were defined as the `default-' versions; this is to
 	facilitate user documentation. set! hack-interactive-move and
 	hack-interactive-resize from minimal.scm to the non-hack versions
 	so they will work right automagically if you use this
 	module. Don't attempt to define any variables in the root
 	module. Various reordering and commenting.

	* minimal.scm: Use hack-interactive-move and
 	hack-interactive-resize, temporarily defined to the rubber-band
	versions, in complex operations.

	* tile.scm: Use raise parameter instead of restack; change default
 	to 'restack-only; fix documentation to say "tile" instead of
 	"cascade"; thanks to Eli Barzilay <eli@CS.Cornell.EDU>.

Wed Dec  2 08:42:49 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* tile.scm: New procedures `tile-windows' and `tile'. Similar to
 	cascade.scm, inspired by Andrew Veliath's FvwmTile.

Tue Dec  1 21:24:57 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* cascade.scm (cascade-windows): Don't nest a let* immediately in
 	a let, just use a let*.

	* Makefile.am (scwm_common_scheme): Make sure to install all
 	Scheme files (other than minimal.scm). Bug report from Carl
 	R. Witty (cwitty@newtonlabs.com).

1998-12-01  Sam Steingold  <sds@goems.com>

	* flux.scm (move-inside): new function: ensures that the window is
	inside the viewport.
	(place-at-point): new function: place the window at mouse point.

1998-11-22  Todd Larason  <jtl@molehill.org>

	* base.scm (scwm-user-var): change #:menu-look tag to #:look for
	(menu) form, to match (menu-style) and reduce redundancy

Fri Nov 20 15:06:59 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* animation.scm: Added doc comment that got lost when this got
	moved into a scheme file.  Changed the default for
	move-pointer-too to #t (since this takes viewport positions, I
	think it's justified, and matches the old behaviour)

Fri Nov 20 02:03:27 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* ScwmDeskButtons.scm: A trivial pager-like thing (still need to
 	find a way to color the button of the current desk differently).

	* ScwmClock.scm: Example scwmlet using guile-gtk, a sort-of
 	"xclock -digital" replacement.

	* tests/scwm-gtk.scm: Remove cruft unneeded w/ new interface,
	make a bit more interesting.

	* gtk.scm: New module to do all the grungework when you want to
 	use Gtk+ with scwm.

Wed Nov 18 03:32:19 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* auto-raise.scm: Various minor bug fixes; make unfocus-proc
 	actually work. Thanks to Craig Struble <cstruble@vt.edu> for the
 	bug report. Also, use window-focus-change-hook in lieu of
 	broadcast-hook. Minor doc tweak. Also, do not attempt to put
 	variables in the root module. That is not good.

Tue Nov 17 01:25:14 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* wininfo.scm: Really really fix the regexp/icase bug. Fix
 	confirmed by Craig Stuble.

Mon Nov 16 14:54:14 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Make sure all scheme files are noticed by `make
 	dist'.

	* wininfo.scm (define-string-matcher): Finally, a real fix for the
 	regexp/icase thing, from Craig Struble <cstruble@vt.edu>. Thanks!

1998-11-16  Sam Steingold  <sds@goems.com>

	* animation.scm (animated-move-to): use `display-height' and
	`cadr' for y instead of `display-width' and `car'.

Sun Nov 15 14:35:03 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* wininfo.scm (define-string-matcher): Try another way to pass
 	regexp/icase properly (whee).

	* shutdown-opts.scm: New module which exports shutdown-options
 	procedure, a way to configure whether you want scwm to switch to
 	viewport (0 0) and/or move all windows to the current viewport at
 	shutdown.

	Makefile.am: install it.

	* themes.scm, fvwm-modules.scm: Expect shutdown-hook procedures to
 	get a restarting? argument

	* wininfo.scm (define-string-matcher): Pass value of regexp/icase,
 	not the quoted symbol regexp/icase, to make-regexp. Bug report from
	Craig Struble <cstruble@vt.edu>.

Sat Nov 14 14:40:24 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am: install report-usage.scm

	* report-usage.scm: New file which has a function to log usage. If
 	this works, users could log usage by doing:

	(use-modules (app scwm report-usage))
	(report-scwm-usage)

	and we can remove support for logging usage from the core.

	* style.scm: Add back style-one-window.

	* animation.scm: Export set-animation!

1998-11-11  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* flux.scm (extreme): New function - calculates extreme values of
	predicates.

Tue Nov 10 10:02:02 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Fix netscape-new-window variable to use comment-based
	docstring, and added the closing paren that was missing (as
	noticed by Ken Pizzini)

Mon Nov  9 10:34:40 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Install animation.scm, themes.scm, theme-impl.scm

Sun Nov  8 17:59:23 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* themes.scm, theme-impl.scm: A start at implementing "themes",
 	i.e. packages that can be loaded into scwm setting only the look,
 	but not messing with the feel. Right now this handles only window
 	decorations and backgrounds. Menu support is one obvious thing
 	that needs to be added. However, theme support is being designed
 	to be flexible, so themes can be used per-window, and eventually
 	per-menu when menu support is added. See the new "themes"
 	directory in the distribution for example themes. Themes may be
 	directories, tar files, or gzipped tar files. themes.scm is meant
 	to be imported into a scwmrc; it provides `use-themes' for
 	handling global theme settings and a `#:use-theme' style option
 	for setting themes per-window. theme-impl.scm is meant to be
 	imported by theme control files and provides important
 	functionality for them.

	* minimal.scm: Some changes to minimize unnecessary hogging of
 	colors (don't define colors or things that reference them to
 	global variables).

Sat Nov  7 15:47:30 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* wininfo.scm: Export always? and never? predicates.

	* style.scm: Significant rewrite; use new representation of styles
 	which includes the test condition and which makes a chain of
 	styles itself a style; this will make theme support much easier
 	and will help add advanced features, like intelligent style
 	merging which will ensure you don't waste memory if you change
 	styles a lot. New exported procedures include `clear-style',
 	`make-conditional-style' and `apply-style', other than that the
 	interface is mostly the same. Also, `window-style' and friends
 	will now complain about bad keyword options.

	* style-options.scm: Change the way style options are stored;
 	abstract accessors style-option:handler, style-option:type and
 	style-option:cumulative should now be used to get info about style
 	options. The various procs for adding style options have extra
 	arguments for specifying type and the cumulative setting. A style
 	option is "cumulative" if setting it more than once should not
 	wipe out earlier settings, for instance #:use-style or
 	#:other-proc.

	* file.scm: Don't check if the file is a directory in
 	`find-file-in-path' or `filename-is-complete?'.

Wed Oct 28 00:03:55 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* cascade.scm: Fixed a bug in cascade (use raise, not restack to
 	test desired raise behavior).

	* cascade.scm: Added `cascade' and `cascade-windows', inspired by
 	Andrew Veliath's FvwmCascade module for fvwm. However, this
 	version is more flexible, takes one eighth the code, excluding
 	comments, and was coded and tested in two hours including
 	docs. For a good time, try binding something to
	(lambda () (cascade #:by-stacking #t #:reverse #t)).

Tue Oct 27 22:55:35 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* winlist.scm: Document #:reverse options.

	* winlist.scm: Add #:reverse optional argument to list-windows and
 	show-window-list-menu - you might very well want to go in the
 	reverse of the stacking order, for instance.

	* base.scm: Remove references to animatio-related options in
 	move-to.

	* animation.scm: Re-export animated-move-window,
 	animated-window-shade, and animated-window-unshade from the
 	c-animation module. Add animated-toggle-window-shade and
 	animated-move-to. Users should only need to import this module
 	directly, not c-animation, since it re-exports the primitives.

	* style.scm: Make #:start-window-shaded option use window-unshade,
 	not un-window-shade.

	* winops.scm: remove various -animated operations from here.

	* wininfo.scm: Numerous bug fixes to the new stuff here.

1998-10-23  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* flux.scm, prefs-menu.scm, std-menus.scm: Use `user-name' instead
	of `USER', `user-home' instead of `HOME'.

	* flux.scm: Remove `USER' and `HOME'.

Thu Oct 22 05:44:55 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Install listops.scm and file.scm

1998-10-20  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* tests/misc.scm: test-caseification of older tests.
	New tests for `user-name' and `user-home'.


Mon Oct 19 04:07:15 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* style.scm: Added default-style-condition-handler public variable
 	(set to window-match?? by default) which is the procedure applied
 	to string style conditions to get a predicate.

	Edited Greg's comment on this code to note he can now do this and
 	be happy:

	 (set! default-style-condition-handler class-match??)
	 (set! default-matcher-type 'regexp)


	* wininfo.scm: Added a new system of predicate makers which return
 	`eq?' predicates when given `equal?' arguments. This will become
 	important with some of the upcoming changes to style
 	handling. Predicates and meta-predicates added include:

	title-match?? STRING #&optional TYPE CASE-SENSITIVE
	class-match?? STRING #&optional TYPE CASE-SENSITIVE
	resource-match?? STRING #&optional TYPE CASE-SENSITIVE
	icon-title-match?? STRING #&optional TYPE CASE-SENSITIVE
	client-hostname-match?? STRING #&optional TYPE CASE-SENSITIVE

	  Each of these returns a predicate which matches an appropriate
 	aspect of a window to the given pattern string; TYPE may be
 	'exact, 'regexp or 'wildcard; CASE-SENSITIVE may be #t or #f.

	always? WIN
	  Returns #t for any value of WIN.
	never? WIN
	  Returns #f for any value of WIN.

	win-and?? . PREDICATES
	win-or?? . PREDICATES
	win-not?? PREDICATE
	  Returns a predicate that, when applied to a window, is the
 	logical and, logical or, or logical not of the application of
 	PREDICATES or PREDICATE. Some simplification is done.

	window-match?? STRING #&optional TYPE CASE-SENSITIVE
	  Does the logical or of `title-match??', `class-match??'
	and `resource-match??' on the same arguments. wildcard-matcher
	should be deprecated in favor of this.

	The public variables default-matcher-type and
 	default-matcher-case-sensitive control the default values of TYPE
 	and CASE-SENSITIVE in all the above.

	* optargs.scm: Fix minor bug that stress-testing with real scwm
 	runs found.

Sun Oct 18 16:14:59 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* listops.scm: Fix some argument name mismatches among
 	declarations, docstrings and bodies. Added `delete-duplicates'.

1998-10-18  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* base.scm: add menu-side-image, menu-side-bg-color,
	menu-side-bg-color-set and menu-bg-image variables,
	(set-menu-background!): if (not menu-side-bg-color-set), set
	menu-side-bg-color to the new menu bg color
	(set-menu-side-image!): new function
	(set-menu-side-background!): new function
	(set-menu-bg-image!): new function
	(menu-style): new tags #:bg-image, #:side-image and #:side-bg
	(menu): image-side, color-bg-image-side and image-bg change
	default values, to enable menu-style to set them

1998-10-17  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* flux.scm (position-message-window!): add a '.' to the end of the
	doc string

	* base.scm (set-menu-foreground!, set-menu-background!,
	set-menu-stipple!, set-menu-font!, set-menu-look!): added
	documentation
	(unset-message-window-position!): added '.' at end of doc string

1998-10-16  Sam Steingold  <sds@goems.com>

	* flux.scm (system-info-string): fix alignment.

Thu Oct 15 08:03:03 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm (maximize): Patch from Ken Pizzini to handle
 	partially off the left and top windows by moving them wholly on
 	screen when maximized

Wed Oct 14 00:39:02 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

 	* listops.scm: New file of list operations. Better than
  	common-list because: more traditional Scheme names and interfaces
  	are used and all implementations are tail-recursive. Should go in
  	guile-core someday, IMO.

  	winlist.scm, style.scm, fvwm-module.scm: use listops.scm instead
  	of common-list.scm; replace calls to `pick' with
  	`filter'. `filter' is better anyway, it doesn't reverse the result
  	like filter does.

 	* fvwm-module.scm: Remove `filename-is-full-path?' and
  	`find-file-in-path'.

 	file.scm: New file to segregate generic file operations that
 	should be more generally available. add `find-file-in-path' and
  	`filename-is-full-path?' (renamed to `filename-is-complete?').

1998-10-13  Robert Bihlmeyer  <e9426626@stud2.tuwien.ac.at>

	* std-menus.scm (context-map): New variable.
	(make-context-menu): New function.

	* flux.scm (execute-on-selection): New function.
	(exe-on-selection): New function.

	* advice.scm: Added a first shot at advising. This is probably not
	very usable yet. Some kind scheme guru should improve/reimplement
	this.

Sun Oct 11 17:40:15 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

 	* face.scm: Specify #&allow-other-keys for `title-style',
  	`border-style' and `button-style'.

 	* optargs.scm: New version supporting the following new features:

 		- More stringent error reporting for lambda* argment list
  		syntax.

 		- `#&rest' available as a synonym for `.' to specify a
  		rest argument.

 		- An error is reported if an unknown keyword argument is
  		passed to a procedure declared with #&key arguments,
  		unless `#&allow-other-keys' is specified in the
  		declaration.

 		- Better code is generated by the macros.

 		- `defmacro*' and `defmacro*-public' are provided; they
  		may be used to declare macros with optional or keyword
  		arguments.

Sat Oct 10 14:25:29 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Added `use-change-desk-commands' and make
	make-rhosts-menu a public function

1998-10-09  Sam Steingold  <sds@goems.com>

	* std-menus.scm (make-hosts-menu): accept a (host . command) as an
	element of host-list.

1998-10-07  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* base.scm (menu-style): treat #:font the same as the other options;
	new option #:look

1998-10-06  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* tests/menus.scm: update tests for new make-menu argument order

	* tests/menu-test.scm: update tests for new make-menu argument order

	* tests/arctic-theme.scm: test/demonstrate more of the ways menu
	looks can be created & used

	* minimal.scm: set-menu-foreground! and set-menu-background!
	primitives renamed set-not-menu-foreground! and
	set-not-menu-background!; set-menu-stipple! removed;  default-menu
	passes colors and font to make-menu as they're now required arguments

	* base.scm:
	new procedures: set-menu-stipple!, set-menu-font! and
	set-menu-look!
	(menu-stipple-color): new
	(menu-look): new
	(set-menu-foreground!): simplified; no need to wrap primitive
	(set-menu-background!): simplified; no need to wrap primitive
	(set-menu-stipple!): new
	(set-menu-font!): new
	(set-menu-look!): new
	(menu): #:color-stipple defaults to 'menu-stipple-color;
	#:menu-look added

	#:show-last-focus-time option to show-window-list-menu

	* wininfo.scm: Added `time-t->seconds-ago' and use it in also
	added `window-last-focus-time-string'

Sun Oct  4 20:25:26 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* fvwm-eval.scm ("Exec"): Don't attempt to apply string-append to
 	args; it's one long string already. Thanks to Doug McNaught
 	<doug@tc.net>.

	Made "Echo" use `display' instead of `write'.

	* cached-program-exists.scm: Make cached-program-exists? check
 	debug-program-cache each time called so debugging can be turned on
 	dynamically; make debug-program-cache a public definition so the
 	user can `set!' it from his or her .scwmrc.

Sun Oct  4 16:51:29 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Use cached-program-exists module and
	cached-program-exists? procedure.  Also use new `first-word' on
	exename so that options to the executable are ignored

1998-10-01  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* flux.scm: renamed set-message-window-position-align! to
	position-message-window! per Greg's suggestion

	and have unmaximize only undo changes attributable to the last
	maximize action.

Sat Sep 26 20:38:30 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Added `background-system' from Jim Blandy, as an
	alternative to `scwm-system'.  We'll need to settle on one
	function for this, but both are now present

1998-09-25  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* flux.scm: Added set-message-window-position-align! as a more
	convenient interfact to set-message-window-position!.  A better
	name would be appreciated.

Thu Sep 24 12:07:09 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* style.scm: Go back to using after-new-window-hook instead of
	before-place-new-window-hook for the window styles.  Todd's patch
	may have fixed the placement-related bugs in a cleaner way.

Wed Sep 23 17:28:34 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* style.scm: Use before-place-new-window-hook instead of
	after-new-window-hook for styles (before-place-new-window-hook is
	new, to fix placement bug)

Wed Sep 23 11:11:58 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* minimal.scm: undefine X-grab-server, X-ungrab-server after
	with-grabbed-server is defined

	* base.scm: No longer define with-grabbed-server here -- do it in
	minimal.scm so we can undefine the primitives that are just used
	for writing it

	* flux.scm: Added find-window-by-class-resource

1998-09-22  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* flux.scm: use-module (app scwm wininfo) to get visible? defined;
	Added X-atomic-property-set-if-unset! implemented with
	with-grabbed-server primitive; Minor cleanup on run-in-netscape,
	and allowing a netscape window to be passed to send a command to a
	particular one.

	* base.scm: Added with-grabbed-server

Mon Sep 21 11:15:34 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Make flash-window take keyword args for color and
	unflash-delay, and use them instead of optional positional
	arguments.  Fixes `select-window-from-window-list' so that it
	correctly highlights the currently-selected window in its hover action

Mon Sep 21 10:28:48 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Added `select-window-group' to allow choosing multiple
	windows interactively.

Sat Sep 19 12:01:16 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Added `with-window-no-wind' macro, since there seems
 	to be a bug in extra calls to select window when
 	broadcast-config-hook is non empty and an interactive-move is
 	invoked inside a dynamically-wound with-window -- see
 	tests/with-window.scm;  drop answer var from with-window, since
	dynamic-wind returns the value of the middle thunk.

Fri Sep 18 15:57:18 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winlist.scm (show-window-list-menu): Added an
 	ignore-winlist-skip option

	* flux.scm: Added `netscape-goto-cut-buffer-url', `netscape-win';
	added ignore-winlist-skip option to
	`select-window-from-window-list'. Fix X-cut-buffer-string to
	return the car of the returned list, and verify that the property
	was a string.  Also added Todd Larason's way-cool
	`run-in-netscape'.

	* base.scm: make move-to handle sticky windows better.  Make
	`with-window' macro use dynamic-wind

1998-09-17  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* base.scm (unset-message-window-position!): Added, to move
	message window to default center-screen position

	* Makefile.am (ETAGS_ARGS): Build TAGS file from .scm files

Thu Sep 17 16:18:55 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* wininfo.scm (windows-overlap?): Use window-virtual-position, not
 	window-position, to take sticky windows into account, and for
	window-geometry-string

	* flux.scm: Fix move-window-to-viewport to be an absolute
	viewport, not a relative one, update docs.  Update
	window-info string to give both virtual and viewport information

	* base.scm: Added window-virtual-position, to give a virtual
	position even for sticky windows

Thu Sep 17 12:07:41 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Fix uses of WIN to be win.  Duh.

	* flux.scm (popup-menu-from-decoration): Don't inc y so much.

Thu Sep 17 11:05:33 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Extend printable-char->keysym-string to be (nearly?)
	complete -- the special characters now work for me.

Thu Sep 17 09:16:53 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Added `delta-position' and `move-window-relative' (the
	latter uses new `with-window' macro

	* base.scm:  Make bell an alias for beep (instead of a macro).
	Added `with-window' macro using new `set-window-context!' and
	`window-context' primitives

Wed Sep 16 08:56:14 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm (maximize, unmaximize): Use
 	move-window-viewport-position, instead of just move-window, and
 	use window-viewport-position to get the current position, instead
 	of window-position.

Tue Sep 15 09:37:57 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Added image-align option to `menu'.  Thanks Todd Larason!

Tue Sep 15 08:31:28 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: More changes to maximize from Ken Pizzini.  Gets the
	unmaximize to undo the maximize, while still moving minimally to
	perform the maximize.

Mon Sep 14 15:53:31 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* fvwm-module.scm (basename): Define if not provided by
	Guile.

Mon Sep 14 10:01:35 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Rework maximize, added unmaximize-no-move.  Thanks
	Ken Pizzini!

Sun Sep 13 19:29:10 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Fixed typo bug in X-synthetic-send-string -- use `win'
	instead of `w'

Sun Sep 13 13:00:37 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winlist.scm: Only use [un]flash-window-proc if not #f

Sun Sep 13 10:39:07 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Use window-viewport-position for maximize so
	max/unmaxed windows do not drift with the viewport-position

	* prefs-menu.scm: Fix typo in Sam's name

	* flux.scm: Added some doc comments, remove window-title-height
	and window-border-width -- use new less hacky versions

	* base.scm: Defined `window-title-{height,width}' in terms of new
	primitive `window-title-size'

Sat Sep 12 13:58:23 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Added `icon-viewport-position', use
	`virtual->viewport' for that and `window-viewport-position'

Fri Sep 11 17:08:01 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winlist.scm: Added {un,}flash-window-proc to
	show-window-list-menu so that we can do stuff like this:

 	(define (show-xterm-window-list-menu)
            (show-window-list-menu #:only
	        (lambda (w) (string=? (window-class w) "XTerm"))
			 #:warp-to-first #t
			 #:flash-window-proc flash-window
			 #:unflash-window-proc unflash-window))

	  to flash windows that are currently highlighted.  Needs better
	  configurability for hover timeouts, but that'll wait until after
	  the event rewrite, as menus may change a bit then.

Fri Sep 11 15:49:33 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Added `unflash-window', and make `flash-window' store
	old colors in scheme properties, instead of a lambda closure (for
	support of highlighting the current window using hover hooks in
	the menuing code [during window-list popups])

Fri Sep 11 13:41:03 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Added animated-move-window (taking virtual coords).

	* base.scm: Added a bunch of utility functions to the base
	module: viewport->virtual, virtual->viewport, viewport-size,
	viewport-{x,y}-position, vx-, vy-

Fri Sep 11 11:49:55 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Clean up comment for scwm-system, drop apply from
 	execlp call; Improve docs for x-, y-, and add
 	viewport-[xy]-position and vx-, vy- for virtual-coordinate
 	analogues of x- and y- (e.g., for move-window, which takes virtual
 	coordinates)

Thu Sep 10 14:39:46 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* wininfo.scm: Fix uses of window-position to use
	window-viewport-position as appropriate.  Added more
	documentation.

	* flux.scm: Added scwm-version-date to show-system-info

Thu Sep 10 11:08:53 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

 	debugging a while back), and give comment response (to MS's GJBFIX
 	note) about why o_nonblock is necessary on the output pipe.

Wed Sep  9 14:25:21 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Added `display-message-briefly'

Wed Sep  9 12:40:50 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Added use-scwm-system variable to control whether
	`system' or `scwm-system' is used.  Wrote `scwm-system' to work
	around a problem in my Linux system's "system" call which ends up
	having scwm/guile propagate a SIGINT to the child processes in the
	same process group.  Make execute use use-scwm-system to decide on
	using either `system' or `scwm-system'.

Tue Sep  8 17:12:59 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* doc.scm: Added use of scwm-variables.txt, don't print "trying
	..." messages for each file -- comment out

Tue Sep  8 13:55:35 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Fix typo in close-window -- Thanks Dale Smith!

Tue Sep  8 10:39:59 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm, minimal.scm:  Remove uses of set-menu-mwm-style!, as
	that primitive and variable are gone now

	* fvwm-eval.scm: Fixed fvwm-command "Scroll" to use percent of
	screen, not number of pixels.  Thanks Dale Smith!

Mon Sep  7 13:47:14 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Document some user vars: xterm-command,
	remote-shell-command, default-menu-max-fold-lines (renamed from
	default-max-fold-lines)

Mon Sep  7 12:18:00 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Fix doc reference to set-title-justify!

Mon Sep  7 11:23:46 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Fix scwm-is-constraint-enabled? proc

Sun Sep  6 16:20:20 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* auto-raise.scm: Added VAR comments, and move the vars into the
	root module.  Also added default-auto-raise-unfocus-delay instead
	of falling back to the default-auto-raise-delay since these delays
	seem conceptually asymmetric to me

	* Makefile.am, user-options.scm:  added user-options.scm
	(autogenerated from doc/Makefile.am)

Sun Sep  6 15:37:45 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Mark variables with ;;;**VAR + comment

Sat Sep  5 15:34:59 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: fix unbalenced paren.

	* Makefile.am: Added sort.scm

	* winlist.scm, wininfo.scm, flux.scm: Document more procedures,
 	and rename var "w" to "win", "w2" to "win2"

Sat Sep  5 14:39:40 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* sort.scm: Added -- This may just be temporary until we start packaging
	some other useful procs from, e.g., slib

	* bincomm.scm, decor.scm, winops.scm: Document more procedures

Sat Sep  5 13:21:02 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Fix typo of extra paren -- thanks Juha Pohjalainen!

Fri Sep  4 18:57:49 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Added docs for some user variables, and document
	them a bit better.  Very tentative format.  In particular, it'd be
	better if doc strings worked on variables (are they supposed to?)

Fri Sep  4 18:54:56 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* tests/constraint-stacking.scm, test/fvwm2-modules.scm: Added

Fri Sep  4 11:52:12 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm (window-viewport-position):  Check for sticky windows
	and handle them correctly.

Fri Sep  4 08:44:31 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Make display-area a variable, and use display-width,
	display-height

	* fvwm-module.scm: Added debug-fvwm-module var, turn on
	non-blocking, make more public function for debugging.

	* fvwm-eval.scm: Use move-window-viewport-position synonym instead
	of move-to. Use display-width, display-height vars

	* fvwm-compat.scm: Use display-width, display-height vars

	* doc.scm: put doc-files in the root module

	* bincomm.scm: binary-write was using default port of
	current-input-port, not current-output-port. fixed.

	* base.scm: Define vars display-width, display-height and use
	them.

1998-09-03  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* tests/test.scm (test-case): Add TITLE argument.

	* tests/properties.scm: Use it.
	Test `X-property-set!' with NAME != TYPE.

Thu Sep  3 15:21:17 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Fix docs of move-to -- it uses a viewport position;
	added move-window-viewport-position as a synonym for move-to

	* fvwm-eval.scm: Reindent.

Wed Sep  2 17:15:37 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm (flash-window): Make it restore the background color
	properly, and make it also set the highlight background color
	(uses the new primitives get-window-colors,
	get-highlight-window-colors, and set-window-highlight-background!

Wed Sep  2 13:31:50 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Do not assume a color is a string -- check first when
	redefining set-menu-{foreground,background}!

	* winops.scm: Added `resize-window' as a synonym for `resize-to'
	as the latter may soon be deprecated.

Wed Sep  2 11:56:36 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Put opaque-{resize,move}-percent in the root module
	by define-ing before the define-module (same hack as in base.scm)

	* prefs-menu.scm: Check scwm-is-constraint-enabled? for
	opaque-move menu -- use opaque-{move,resize}-percent variable

	* base.scm: Added `scwm-is-constraint-enabled?'

Wed Sep  2 10:57:00 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Added `X-cut-buffer-string'

Wed Sep  2 09:58:52 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Use window-viewport-position in
	popup-menu-from-decoration choosing where to put the menu on screen.

Tue Sep  1 16:31:25 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Added move-to, since move-window is the primitive that
	move-to used to be.  move-to moves a window to a viewport
	position, move-window (the primitive) moves a window to a virtual position

	* winops.scm: Updated docs for animated-move-to.

1998-09-01  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* tests/test.scm: New file containing testing facilities.

	* tests/properties.scm: Use them.

1998-08-31  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* flux.scm, wininfo.scm: Scheme sources adapted to new X property
	interface.

	* tests/properties.scm, tests/window-opns.scm: Removed tests for
	old X property interface, added some for the new one.

Tue Aug 25 14:37:43 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* optargs.scm: Preserve docstrings for precedures defined by
 	lambda* (and therefor define* and define*-public).

Fri Aug 21 15:59:15 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ALL: Added RCS-Id as first line, canonicalize copyrights (add
	1998, me where appropriate)

	* flux.scm, face.scm, bincomm.scm, base.scm, auto-raise.scm: Added
 	some documentation, changed formal param "w" to "win" as useful.

Fri Aug 14 19:24:34 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* wininfo.scm, wmconfig-menu.scm: Document a proc in each.

Fri Aug 14 17:13:35 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Added vars `opaque-move-percent' and
	  `opaque-resize-percent', procs `window-frame-area' and
	  `display-area', user-procs `resize-opaquely?' and
	  `move-opaquely?', and procs `interactive-move-maybe-opaque',
	  `interactive-resize-maybe-opaque', `move-or-raise-maybe-opaque',
	  `resize-or-raise-maybe-opaque'.  Document toggle-maximize.

	* std-menus.scm, prefs-menu.scm: Use new form of run-in-xterm w/
	  key arg xterm-options

	* flux.scm: use-module winops, and use
	  interactive-{move,resize}-maybe-opaque when doing
	  interactive-{move,resize}s

	* base.scm: Drop xterm-command to just "xterm", and make
	  run-in-xterm now take #:xterm-options STRING to give options to
	  the xterm program.  It is assummed that "-e" is used as the
	  argument to invoke the CMD.  Also added `scwm-user-var' macro as
	  a means at dynamically looking up a variable in
	  `the-root-module'.  This may not be the right way to do this--
	  feedback is appreciated.

Thu Aug 13 16:20:43 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* minimal.scm: Document all functions.

Thu Aug 13 16:04:20 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Document all public functions.  The define*-public
	  docstrings aren't accessible, though, and the emacs interface
	  seems to not permit %x as a procedure name.  Also changed
	  run-in-xterm to have the -e option already, and fixed std-menus
	  and prefs-menu for that convention.

	* prefs-menu.scm, std-menus.scm: Above mentioned fix to uses of
	  run-in-xterm.

Thu Aug 13 11:19:40 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* wininfo.scm: Fix percent visible to use window-frame-size, not
	  window-size

Wed Aug 12 17:21:31 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm, flux.scm: move "animated-move-to" into here (from
	  flux), and use (app scwm base) module

	* wininfo.scm: Added intersection-area and percent-visible from
	  Todd Larson, and use them in rectangle-overlap?

Wed Aug 12 15:31:33 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Use resize-frame-to and window-frame-size for
	  maxmize function

	* wininfo.scm: Use window-frame-size, except for
	  window-geometry-string which now uses the size in resize-inc
	  units

	* flux.scm, base.scm: Use window-frame-size for w%x, w%y, etc.

Fri Aug  7 17:57:49 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* stacking.scm: Add this new module with list-windows-above,
 	list-windows-below, raise-window-above (corrected from previous
 	version), lower-window-below, lower-by-one and raise-by-one.

	* winops.scm: Remove raise-window-above and lower-window-below
 	from here.

	* winlist.scm: Add #:by-stacking keyword arg to list-windows, and
 	show-window-list-menu.

	Also, since `pick' reverses the result, reverse it again.

	* wininfo.scm: Add windows-overlap? procedure to determine if two
 	windows overlap. Add window-overlaps-window? wrapper for this
 	which basically Currys it.


1998-08-07  Robert Bihlmeyer  <e9426626@stud2.tuwien.ac.at>

	* style.scm: First shot at making squashed-titlebar available as
	  a style option. s-t rocks.

Thu Aug  6 19:26:36 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* wininfo.scm: Fix from Todd Larason <jtl@molehill.org> to use the
	  display-size coordinates minus 1 as args to rectangle-overlap?

Wed Aug  5 20:13:15 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* wininfo.scm: Fix wildcard->regexp to turn ? into ., instead of
	  into .?; rename window-machine-name to window-client-machine-name

	* minimal.scm: Fixes to resize-or-raise and move-or-raise by
	  Stephen Tell.  Do not raise unless it's not a move or resize
	  event.

	* flux.scm: Added get-wm-command,
	  make-string-usable-for-resource-key, and S.Senda's make-rhosts-menu.

Sun Aug  2 16:31:41 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Added lower-window-below, raise-window-above as
	  front-ends to restack-windows.

	* wininfo.scm: added MSFIX: re: wildcard converter.  Added
	  window-machine-name (ideally this could get exposed to an
	  improved wildcard-matcher that distinguishes among Class,
	  Resource, Title, Icon-name, Window-machine-name, etc).

	* flux.scm: Added printable-char->keysym-string and use it to make
	  X-synthetic-send-string work with embedded spaces, newlines,
	  etc.  It's a very primitive keyboard macro facility, now.  Added
	  color->string as an accessor to the name property of a color
	  color->object.

	* doc.scm: Need to use (app scwm flux) for write-all

1998-08-01  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny3-12.ix.netcom.com>

	* fvwm-module.scm (send-mini-icon-packet): Use cdr-assq, not assq
	(and define it above). This should fix Greg's recently reported
	bug w/ mini-icons.

1998-08-01  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny4-24.ix.netcom.com>

	* fvwm-eval.scm ("ClickTime"): Replace set-click-time! with
	set-click-delay!

1998-07-31  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny5-12.ix.netcom.com>

	* base.scm, face.scm, fvwm-eval.scm, minimal.scm: Replace
	set-window-font! with set-title-font!

1998-07-31  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny3-12.ix.netcom.com>

	* base.scm (set-edge-resistance!, set-edge-scroll!,
	set-edge-wrap!): Added these convenience wrappers, but people
	should migrate to the new versions.

1998-07-30  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny3-12.ix.netcom.com>

	* decor.scm (#:use-decor): Deal with reversing the arguments to
	set-window-decor! for this style option.

	* fvwm-eval.scm: Major improvements from Danius Michaelides
	<danius@duff.org>; many more fvwm commands are now supported. See
	the end of the file for the complete support status.

Thu Jul 30 20:21:18 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Added select-multiple-windows-interactively (plus
	example with restack-windows), and select-window-from-window-list
	(plus example)

	* prefs-menu.scm: Cleanup a bit for lack of set-opaque-move-size!
	-- no real attempt to make the new parameter functional, though

Wed Jul 29 19:20:46 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* doc.scm: Added

	* flux.scm: Move doc-files and documentation into doc.scm; Added
	  find-window-by-name and window-bottom from Harvey Stein.

Mon Jul 27 20:07:17 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: use opaque moves by default, for
	  interactive-move-window-with-pointer, etc.

	* Added opaque-interactive-move, opaque-interactive-resize;
	improve messages on warning callbacks

1998-07-24  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Use string-append, duh.

1998-07-23  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Added new doc-files variable setting to use the new
	(scwm-path-prefix) primitive.  (For the new `documentation'
	procedure which accesses scwm-procedures.txt)

1998-07-23  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny1-20.ix.netcom.com>

	* fvwm-module.scm (add-window): Determine the icon file
	correctly. Thanks to Danius Michalides for the bug report.

1998-07-21  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny4-02.ix.netcom.com>

	* fvwm-module.scm: New interface to launching fvwm2 modules. This
	should be a better base for fvwm2 emulation, as well as a more
	convenient interface for users. Added/renamed/modified:

	variable: fvwm2-module-path

	register-fvwm2-module-config MODULE-TYPE . ARGS

	append-fvwm2-module-config MODULE-TYPE . ARGS
	clear-fvwm2-module-config MODULE-TYPE
	get-fvwm2-module-config MODULE-TYPE
	run-fvwm2-module MODULE-NAME #&optional OTHER-ARGS CONFIG-INFO
	  CONFIG-FILE
	kill-fvwm2-module FMOD
	kill-all-fvwm2-modules
	kill-fvwm2-modules-by-name MODULE-NAME

	See the comment at the top of the file for more details.

Tue Jul 21 14:31:08 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* tests/constraints.scm: Added sample of how to write constriants
	using embedded cassowary constraint solver. Constraints are now
	available at the scheme in nearly their full generality.

1998-07-20  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny5-21.ix.netcom.com>

	* fvwm-module.scm: Ignore SIGPIPE if using fvwm modules; they have
	a tendency to break the pipe when you kill them w/o sending KillMe
	(at least for me) for some reason.

	* base.scm (color-property): Added color-property
	procedure. Reversed order of key and object on image-property and
	font-property to be consistent and Schemey.

1998-07-20  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@localhost.localdomain>

	* fvwm-eval.scm ("WarpToWindow"): Make the fvwm2 "WarpToWindow"
	command pick a window to warp to if none specified. Kind of
	stupid, but complete.

	* fvwm-module.scm: Support the broadcast-mini-icon-hook. Also,
	make send-window-list send the complete list of information, just
	like fvwm2 sends it. Many things were missing before.

	* fvwm-module.scm (run-fvwm-module): Make sure to do something
	more sensible when reciving a packet that specifies no
	window. Patch from Danius Michaelides <danius@duff.org>

	* fvwm-eval.scm: Handle the case where no window is specified more
	gracefully. Add support for Exec, Restart, Quit, Resize, Lower,
	and WarpToWindow fvwm commands. Add support for a special Eval
	command; this lets Fvwm modules evaluate arbitrary Scheme
	expressions, allowing for FvwmButtons configs for instance, to be
	very flexible. Patch from Danius Michaelides <danius@duff.org>

1998-07-15  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny2-12.ix.netcom.com>

	* style.scm: Added #:placement-proc and #:transient-placement-proc
	style options, to allow setting user-defined placement
	procedures. See C code directory ChangeLog for rationale on
	splitting these, and what procedures may be used from within a
	placement proc.

Mon Jul  6 01:51:30 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* auto-raise.scm: Replaced window-from-window-id with id->window.

	* fvwm-module.scm: Removed now useless definition of id->window.

1998-07-06  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* prefs-menu.scm: Added animation-ms-delay define, since it must
	be known before the prefs-menu definition.

	* flux.scm: add an extra menu-separator after menu-title, to make
	look more like the prefs-menu and xlock-menu

1998-07-04  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* std-menus.scm: Use xlock-query-program to decide what to run to
	query the modes for the screensaver

	* base.scm: comment out the remove-hook! macro, since there is
	also code that defines the macro iff it's not already defined;
	add reset-hook! macro
	set invalid-interaction-hook and cannot-grab-hook to ring the bell
	with (beep)

1998-06-26  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny1-21.ix.netcom.com>

	* fvwm-module.scm(run-fvwm-module): Add a few sanity checks to
	make sure running a nonexistent module won't break things.

1998-06-23  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny1-07.ix.netcom.com>

	* std-menus.scm: Use the (ice-9 regex) module.

1998-06-20  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@localhost.localdomain>

	* fvwm-module.scm: Use the new input hook system (add-input-hook!
	and remove-input-hook!, instead of using add-input-hook and
	counting on the hook being a one-shot).

Wed Jun 10 02:19:58 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* auto-raise.scm, flux.scm: minor typos fixed, thanks to Shuji
 	Narazaki <narazaki@dai.comp.kyutech.ac.jp> for the bug report and
 	patch.

Mon Jun  1 20:34:30 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: regenerated with automake 1.3

Thu Apr  2 18:08:09 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* minimal.scm: Set the rubber band mask to something better so the
 	rubber band actually shows up on 16bpp and higher systems by
 	default. Bug report from Francesco Tapparo
 	<f.tapparo@vi.nettuno.it>.

Mon Mar 30 15:38:00 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* auto-raise.scm: New auto-raise module. The #:auto-raise,
 	#:auto-raise-delay, #:auto-raise-focus-proc,
 	#:auto-raise-unfocus-proc and #:auto-raise-unfocus-delay window
 	style options added by this module control auto-raise. Still not
 	as general as I'd like (it should be possible to set an arbitrary
 	number of independent focus-unfocus pairs so you could do typical
 	autoraise and the maximize-unmaximize hack independently with
 	different timeouts), but will e eventually. See the file for
 	exaple usage.

	Makefile.in: Install auto-raise.scm

Sun Mar 29 18:19:57 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* fvwm-module.scm: Define and export kill-all-fvwm-modules which
 	kills all active fvwm modules; add it to the shutdown hook.

	* style.scm: Use new-style new-window hooks.

	* minimal.scm: Remove reliance on old-style new-window hooks;
 	they're not really needed anymore anyway, AddWindow should set
 	default colors of some sort.

Sun Mar 29 10:47:24 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: Add transient? to window-info

	* fvwm-eval.scm: Fix typo that showed up with FvwmWinList

Sun Mar 29 15:04:31 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* base.scm: Add thunk macro.

	* base.scm: Only define remove-hook! if not already defined by
 	Guile.

Fri Mar 27 19:25:19 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* fvwm-module.scm: Use the new interface for broadcast hooks.

	* base.scm: Added remove-hook! to complement guile's add-hook!.

Thu Mar 26 11:32:29 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* fvwm-module.scm: Send more information to the module in
 	send-window-list (still not quite all that fvwm sends). Also a few
 	minor bug fixes. FvwmWinList now works.

	* fvwm-eval.scm: Added support for "Focus" and "Iconify" fvwm
 	builtins, reportedly needed by TkDesk.

Wed Mar 25 14:38:03 1998  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux.scm: use-module (ice-9 regex)

	* prefs-menu.scm: define-module misnamed the module -- removed
	trailing `s' from the name so prefs-menu matches the file name.
	Also added a comment about ask-string and how it might work...

Tue Mar 24 16:43:32 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.in (install): install flux.scm

Tue Mar 24 16:09:00 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* fvwm-compat.scm: Added all the FvwmM4 simple macros like
 	X_RESOLUTION, and CLASS

	* flux.scm: added sleep-ms and X-synthetic-send-string

Tue Mar 24 14:15:16 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* fvwm-module.scm: Append newlines to the configuration strings;
 	this is needed to make the pager happy with geometry
 	specifications and maybe other things. Bug report and patch from
 	Bucky LaDieu <nega@vt.edu>.

Mon Mar 23 15:47:45 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Added flux.scm: Pulled out a bunch of
	functions from gjb.scwmrc (many originally from sds.scwmrc) and
	put here so we could share them better as we decide how to
	migrate the functionality into standard functionality (or do
	something different).

Wed Mar 11 21:05:11 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* fvwm-compat.scm, bincomm.scm, fvwm-module.scm: Use close-port
 	instead of close for guile 1.2 compatablility. Bug report from
 	Bucky LaDieu <nega@vt.edu>.

Tue Mar 10 22:39:58 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* fvwm-compat.scm: Added a bunch of commented out functions for
 	FvwmM4 pre-defines; these need to be fleshed out, but I wanted to
 	get the code started so I could see/think about what new
 	primitives we'll need to support the defines.

Fri Mar  6 02:50:47 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* fvwm-module.scm: Slight corrections to the extra argument stuff;
 	also, broadcast the page info to modules that request the window
 	list.

	* base.scm: A few changes to make menu-style work right.

	* fvwm-module.scm: Added optional other-args argument to module.

Thu Mar  5 00:33:50 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* fvwm-eval.scm: Added support for the KillMe fvwm module command,
 	so modules can kill themselves.

1998-03-04  Jens-Ulrik Petersen  <petersen@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp>

	* winlist.scm (circulate): Improved its behaviour when there is no
	window with focus.

Mon Mar  2 23:49:19 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* std-menus.scm, wmconfig-menu.scm: minor fixes from Sam Steingold
 	<sds@usa.net>

Sun Mar  1 02:21:15 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Install the new modules.

	* fvwm-module.scm: A new module that allows fvwm2 modules to be
 	run from within scwm. The relevant procedures are run-fvwm-module
 	and kill-fvwm-module.

	* fvwm-eval.scm: A new module to support evaluating fvwm2rc
 	lanugage expressions. The primary use is for the fvwm module
 	support code. The principal export is fvwm-eval which takes a
 	string expression and optionally a module (as returned by
 	run-fvwm-module) and a window.

	* bincomm.scm: A new module for binary communication; it's
 	intended to be used by the fvwm module code, but code to support
 	other legacy module protocols may want to use it as well. It may
 	be helpful to rewrite this in C someday.

Sat Feb 28 01:34:28 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* image-loaders.scm: A new file that supports loading images in
 	foreig formats through several converters. Slower than native
 	loading, but better than nothing. Exported procedures are
 	ImageMagick-loader and netpbm-loader, which try to use their
 	namesake packages to convert the image to xpm and then try to load
 	it, try-everything-loader which tries both in order and will
 	support any other available conversion methods in the future, and
 	support-image-conversion, a simple wrapper which establishes
 	try-everything-loader as the default loader.

	Makefile.in: Install image-loaders.scm.

	* Makefile.in: Install wmconfig-menu.scm, std-menus.scm

	* base.scm: Added run-in-xterm from Sam Steingold <sds@usa.net>

	* std-menus.scm: Renamed the former xlock-menu.scm to this and
 	added make-hosts-menu, a useful menu for a set of hosts to telnet
 	to.

	* wmconfig-menu.scm: Added documentation and miscellaneous fixes
 	from Sam Steingold <sds@usa.net>.

Wed Feb 25 21:39:58 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* wmconfig-menu.scm: New module contributed by Sam Steingold
 	<sds@usa.net> - this provides the function make-wmconfig-menu,
 	which parses the Red Hat 5.0 /etc/X11/wmconfig directory and
 	returns a mennu which reflects its contents. The title and name of
 	the menu, and the directory to scan, may optionally be specified
 	in that order. Appropriate defaults are provided.

	* xlock-menu.scm: New module contributed by Sam Steingold - the
 	key exciting bit is the make-xlock-menu function which creates a
 	menu with several xlock screensaver choices. The optional argument
 	specifies wether or not to lock the screen when launching
 	screensavers; the default is #f.

	* base.scm: Added fold-menu-list and exe, contributed by Sam
 	Steingold.

	fold-menu-list takes a menu and an optional number of lines, and
 	splits it at that number of lines (or 30 by default), adding
 	"more..."-labeled submenu entries. exe is just a wrapper around
 	execute that returns a procedure which will run the specified
 	command.

	* minimal.scm: Changed load-font reference to make-font

	* base.scm: Changed references to load-font to use make-font
 	instead; defined load-font as make-font for compatability;
 	font-property function for getting single properties of a font.

Fri Feb 20 04:42:04 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* base.scm: Added image-property convenience wrapper to get at
 	individual image properties.

	* style.scm: Added #:show-icon and #:force-icon options, removed
 	some crufty old comments.

Fri Dec 12 16:15:28 1997  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Permit a string action in a menuitem to mean (execute
 	string), permit string color-bg and color-text in a menu, use
 	'menu-text-color, 'menu-bg-color, and 'menu-font as the defaults
 	so they can be redefined later -- note that the user must still
 	define these variables in their .scwmrc before building menus or
 	else the quoted symbol doesn't work (symbol table scope issue due
	to modules?)

Sun Nov 30 11:56:30 1997  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Use new menuing interface: menu-title and
 	menu-separator are new variables, (menu ..) and (menuitem ..) are
 	new public definitions

	* minimal.scm: Use new primitive menu interface -- make-menu and
 	make-menuitem.

	* winlist.scm: Make show-window-list-menu use new menuing
 	interface

Mon Nov 10 05:43:11 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* fvwm-compat.scm: In fvwm-pipe-read, use dup to properly connect
 	the pipe to the standard output for the subprocess.

	* style.scm: Use make-image in lieu of make-picture.

Mon Nov 10 00:16:04 1997  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: added toggle-window-shade-animated

Sun Nov  9 16:45:50 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* base.scm: Added a new more abstract syntax for menu items to
 	allow more flexibility in changing the menu implementation;
 	procedures menu-title, menu-separator and menu-item should be used
 	to specify menu items instead of explicitly passing symbols or
 	lists.

	* style.scm: stop using set-icon-maybe-name! and
 	set-mini-icon-maybe-name! and comment them out; would rather have
 	string handling in the primitvs for now.

Sat Nov  8 20:35:26 1997  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* style.scm: allow pixmaps or strings in window styles

Fri Nov  7 03:26:00 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* base.scm: Renamed title-style to simple-title-style; the real
 	title-style is now in face.scm.

	* face.scm: New file face.scm which implements a friendlier
 	interface to title, button and border styles than the primitve
 	interface. The exported procedures are title-style, border-style
 	and button-style; they are somewhat analogous to the fvwm builtins
 	with similar names.

Mon Nov  3 01:12:41 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* decor.scm: Add the #:use-decor style option.

1997-10-31  Jens-Ulrik Holger Petersen  <petersen@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp>

	* winlist.scm (#:winlist-skip): add-boolean-style-option

1997-10-24  Jens-Ulrik Holger Petersen  <petersen@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp>

	* Makefile.in (mostlyclean): New target.

	* wininfo.scm (window-geometry-string): Format geometry output
	in standard way.

	* winlist.scm (winlist-skip?): Fixed; was constant #f.

Thu Oct 23 20:03:30 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* decor.scm: Added some basic support for decors: the
 	call-with-decor procedure and with-decor macro.

	* style.scm, style-options.scm, winlist.scm, winops.scm: Split
 	style.scm into styles.scm which provides the various style
 	commands and style-options.scm which provides the tables of style
 	options and hooks to add new ones. style.scm now does not need to
 	use every module that may define procedures that should be
 	available as style options; the files can just use the (app scwm
 	style-options) module and define relevant options themselves. This
 	was done for #:circulate-skip, #:circulate-skip-icon,
 	#:winlist-skip, and #:start-maximized.

Tue Oct 21 21:04:31 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* style.scm: Change #:mwm-buttons from a style option to a hint
 	option.

Mon Oct 20 06:10:38 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* winlist.scm: Circulate (and therefore prev-window and
 	next-window) were giving an error when no window in the window
 	list satisfied the given conditions.  This is now fixed. Bug
 	reported by Jens-Ulrik Holger Petersen
 	<petersen@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp>.

	* wininfo.scm: in-viewport-any-desk? and visible? were not working
 	correctly when the viewport is away from 0,0; this is fixed. Bug
 	reported by Jens-Ulrik Holger Petersen
 	<petersen@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp>.

Sun Oct 19 01:33:50 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Use mkinstalldirs to create the scwm scheme
 	directory if necessary.

Sat Oct 18 02:19:58 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* wininfo.scm: wildcard-matcher: reversed the order of the if and
 	then clauses in (if full-regexp ...). Patch from Mikael
 	Djurfeldt <mdj@nada.kth.se>

Fri Oct 17 18:18:55 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* style.scm: The 'new-window and 'new-window-hint event handlers
 	were changes to call the old handler first and then execute the
 	style hooks.

	Also, the #:lenience style option was added.

	* base.scm: Fixed a bug in move-viewport - the let syntax was
 	incorrect. Bug report and fix from Holger Petersen
 	<petersen@kurmis.kyotou.ac.jp>

	* Makefile.in: Added VPATH support.
