Sat Mar 30 03:56:16 2002  Scott Lenser  <slenser@gs104.sp.cs.cmu.edu>

	* auto-shrink.scm: Made 'shrink-inactive-windows' use the delay-seconds
	parameter it is passed.  Added missing :use-module line for
	(app scwm time-convert).

	Added doc strings to public functions missing them.

Sat Mar 30 03:29:51 2002  Scott Lenser  <slenser@gs104.sp.cs.cmu.edu>

	* undo.scm: Documented public variables.
	Updated and greatly improved documentation.
	Deprecated 'decrement-undo-index', 'increment-undo-index',
	'insert-undo-global', and 'insert-undo-state'.  The first 2
	should be private and the last 2 were broken and had bizarre
	semantics to begin with so I decided to deprecate instead of
	fix.

	Fixed bug in undo/redo that would result in having to do 2
	undos/redos in a row to reverse the effect of the last redo/undo.

	Implemented paying attention to undo-max-entries so that we don't
	just keep growing memory in the comon usage case.  Added function
	'truncate-undo-list' in the process to constrain the undo-list to
	be no larger than a given number.  Exported as public since may be
	useful to users.

Tue Mar 26 23:40:09 2002  Scott Lenser  <slenser@cs.cmu.edu>

	* window-configuration.scm: Added storing state of iconified?,
	sticky-window?, icon-sticky?, and shaded?.  The code to save
	and restore all this state is there but some of it is non-functional
	due to problems with the C routines.  Only recommended using for
	saving/restoring position/size in non-iconified state, stickiness,
	and iconification state until C routines can be fixed.  It is now
	pretty safe to run
	(restore-global-configuration (global-window-configuration)) as a
	noop.

	Added wrapper functions to extract the interesting bits from a saved
	window configuration.  This will allow the format to change in the
	future without breaking backwards compatibility.

Sun Feb 17 06:05:59 2002  Scott Lenser  <slenser@cs.cmu.edu>

	* wininfo.scm: Changed windows-overlap? to consider a window as
	overlapping itself.  This changes the effect of 
	window-overlaps-window? and list-overlapping-windows.

	* stacking.scm: Changed name of lower-window-below to
	restack-window-below and raise-window-above to restack-window-above.
	Added compatability defines for the old names with a deprecated
	comment.  The change in the behavior of windows-overlap? fixes the
	restack-window-below/above routines so that they actually work.

Sun Feb 17 05:42:42 2002  Scott Lenser  <slenser@cs.cmu.edu>

	* easyraise.scm: Added FIXME for very slow memory leak potential.

Sun Feb 17 05:01:09 2002  Scott Lenser  <slenser@cs.cmu.edu>

	* base.scm: Moved doc and implementation to
	move-window-viewport-position from compatibility name of
	move-to.  Both names are still valid but docs should now
	show up under preferred name.

Sun Feb 17 04:55:55 2002  Scott Lenser  <slenser@cs.cmu.edu>

	* easyraise.scm: Fixed bug in set-easyraise-window! which
	wouldn't update the variable easyraise-windows which would
	cause the wrong windows to get raised lowered.

Sat Feb 16 02:01:31 2002  Scott Lenser  <slenser@cs.cmu.edu>

	* dir-focus.scm: Improved doc string for dir-focus to mention
	that this focus movement is relative to the location of the
	pointer.

	* focus-stack.scm: Added period to doc string.

	Put FIXME comment on a minor race condition problem.

Sat Feb 16 01:12:38 2002  Scott Lenser  <slenser@cs.cmu.edu>

	* hover-focus.scm: Moved the add-hook! calls into a 
	install-hover-focus function so that hover-focus can be
	re-installed after being uninstalled.

Sun Feb 10 03:53:04 2002  Scott Lenser  <slenser@cs.cmu.edu>

	* focus-stack.scm: Changed pop-focus-window so that it skips
	over windows that are no longer valid.  Changed 
	close-window-and-pop-focus so that it uses get-window if the
	window is not specified for consistency with other functions.
	Changed close-window-and-pop-focus so that the window always
	gets deleted even if the focus stack is empty.

Sun Nov 11 02:30:29 2001  Scott Lenser  <slenser@cs.cmu.edu>

	* bincomm.scm: Fixed bug in long->string that output 0 for high
	byte if the high bit of the high byte is set.

	* fvwm-eval.scm: Improved commenting of some things for FIXMEs.

	* fvwm-module.scm: Fixed catches using call-with-output-string to
	take the port to output to like they are supposed to.  Added debug
	output to show the file descriptors used to talk to the fvwm
	module.  Improved the reporting of errors encountered while
	executing an fvwm command for a module.

Sat Jun 24 14:22:58 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm-gtk-pager.scm: Set default width/height to 10/10, since it
	looks like gtk uses the drawarea's size as the minimum size.  This 
	needs to be fixed. GJB:FIXME::

Sun Jun 18 22:13:44 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* file.scm: Added `string-list->string' to do the old list->string 
	behaviour that accepted strings, not just character arguments, and 
	use it in `path-list->string-with-colons'.

	* bincomm.scm: Redefine integer->char to permit -1 as an argument
	and turn it into 0.  Not sure what the right fix is right now.

Sun Jun 18 20:01:51 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* lambda-startup-logo.scm: Use *-small.xpm logos, just added to
	the scwm-icons cvs module.

Mon Jun  5 10:19:05 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gregb@go2net.com>

	* netscape.scm: Added `netscape-metacrawler-search-selection-url', 
	`netscape-metacrawler-search', `netscape-new-window',
	`netscape-window-not-focussed'.  Use the latter for
	*netscape-new-window* which now can be a proc or a boolean-- if
	it's a proc, it gets evaled and the return value is used to
	determine if a new window should be used.

Tue May  9 22:50:54 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* rgb-database.scm,gnome-hints.scm: Remove extra paren. Thanks Eli
 	Barzilay.

	* register.scm: Added `popup-register-winlist'

Tue May  2 07:54:46 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* gnome-hints.scm: Protect gnome-update-layer from WIN == #f.
	Thanks to Michael Schmitz!

Sat Apr 29 12:41:35 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* gnome-hints.scm: Make gnome-update-state do nothing if WIN is
	#f.  Fixes bug of unwanted get-window calls when the gnome-pager
	is hidden. Thanks to Michael Schmitz for reporting and helping
	track this down!

2000-04-13  Jeff Nichols  <jwnichls@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm-gtk-pager.scm: Double-buffering added for improved
	drawing performance.  Changed expose-event to use draw-pager
	because black windows were being drawn. <-- Unsure of reason
	here.

Thu Apr 13 01:17:39 2000    <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm-gtk-pager.scm: Factor out hooks-for-pager and use it in
	both set-pager-hooks and unset-pager-hooks.  Reduce it to just
	have broadcast-hook and broadcast-config-hook.  This not only
	simplifies the code, but also makes flashing windows work.  Use
	really-draw-pager for the expose-event.  Make the initialization
	all occur in initialize-pager, not in top-level defines.  Make
	show-pager call really-draw-pager right away.  Make
	really-draw-pager reset need-to-draw-pager to #f right away.
	There seems to be a problem with blinking windows that causes
	need-to-draw-pager to get stuck at #t when really-draw-pager is
	not in the timer hooks list.  This causes the pager to stall
	updates until an expose event forces a really-draw-pager.

Thu Apr 13 00:58:04 2000    <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm-gtk-pager.scm: Use the actual background color of the
	window instead of just checking to see if it's got the focus.
	Make draw-pager take an arbitrary number of arguments, and
	eliminate the specific procedures for each hook, just add
	draw-pager to the various hooks.  Handle the
	window-selection-add-hook, window-selection-remove-hook so that
	selected windows get highlighted in the pager.

	* base.scm:  Added window-foreground-color,
	window-background-color, color->string.

	* flux.scm: Move window-background-color into base.scm

Wed Apr 12 17:27:35 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm-gtk-pager.scm: Avoid pager deadlock when windows close or
	viewport changes.

2000-04-10  Jeff Nichols  <jwnichls@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Added scwm-gtk-pager.scm to the list of gtk 
	modules.

	* scwm-gtk-pager.scm: Removed some garbage text from header.  
	Removed pager-compare function for on-current-desk? from wininfo.

	* scwm-gtk-pager.scm: Changed variable name for readability and
	commented out a debug variable.

2000-04-06  Jeff Nichols  <jwnichls@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm-gtk-pager.scm: Added viewport position and focus 
	indicators.

	* scwm-gtk-pager.scm: Added a simple, vaguely functional pager
	written using guile-gtk.  Doesn't respond to mouse events, so 
	it's only good as a window on your world.

Sun Mar 26 14:22:00 2000    <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Fix hotspot in anchor pixmap.  Use
	get-window-with-nonant-interactively for
	interactive-set-window-gravity!

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Turn on
	`start-highlighting-selected-window', off
	`end-highlighting-selected-window' properly instead of doing the
	start- once at the beginning of the file.  Makes all selections
	highlight the current window.

	* placement.scm: Only turn on the ui-constraint if
	scwm-is-constraint-enabled? and (scwm-master-solver) returns
	non-#f.

	* nonants.scm: Added cursor option to
	get-window-with-nonant-interactively to support
	interactive-set-window-gravity!

	* flux.scm: s/send-key-press/send-key/g

	* dir-focus.scm: Use focus-change-warp-pointer, instead of
	inlining roughly the same code.  Uses winops module now.

Sat Mar 18 14:09:04 2000    <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm, nonants.scm: Move
 	`canonicalize-nonant' into nonants.scm.  Improve the procedure to
	handle numbers, north-west, etc.

Wed Mar 15 15:39:31 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Added `canonicalize-nonant', and use 
	it throughout. 

	* placement.scm: Make `near-window-placement' return the list of
	two windows for strict-relpos-placement to work with.  Added
	`strict-relpos-placement' to add the constraint persisting the
	relationship.

	* netscape.scm: Use strict-relpos-placement for the findDialog_popup.

Sun Mar 12 13:11:11 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Added `string-contains-slash?', better
	`program-exists?', from path-cache.scm

	* path-cache.scm: Use the `program-exists?' from base.scm (moved
	it there from here). 

Thu Feb 24 16:58:39 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* where-is.scm: Better error handling of not-found procedures.

	* viavoice.scm: Handle "move window center" phrase.

	* reflection.scm: Handle undefined procedures in
	`procedure-string->procedure'

Thu Feb 24 08:28:29 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops-menu.scm: Added menu-re-place-window.  Move Focus submenu 
	further down in the menu-window-ops.

	* viavoice.scm: Move "cotton" matches-command? earlier since it
	also contains the word "down" and the matching is done very
	stupidly!

	* undo.scm: Fix `insert-undo-state' to better verify indices.
	Untested.

	* snap-constraints.scm: Require that both windows stickiness be
	the same. Make `snap-reset' and `snap-initialize' both
	interactive.

	* register.scm: Added `get-register-alist', `register-value-type', 
	`register-type-mapping', `register-type-mapping-string'.  All for
	nicer register GUI.

	* placement.scm: Added `re-place-window', needs animation module.

	* gtk-table-display.scm: Added some new options, make a bit more
	robust.  Now used for the registers GUI as well as the URLs GUI.

	* flux-gtk.scm: Added `gtk-register-info', needs undo, register
	modules

Wed Feb 23 18:26:19 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* tests/demo.scm: Fix iconified? to iconified-window?

	* ui-constraints-toggle-menu.scm: Make
	popup-ui-constraints-toggle-menu interactive.

	* register.scm: Added optional DESCIPTOR argument to
	get-register-name, and use it to make the prompts better.

Mon Feb 21 18:12:28 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* tile.scm: Call `insert-undo-global' before tiling in
	`tile-windows-interactively'

	* register.scm: Ensure that the register is not empty before
	`jump-to-register' acts on register value and use
	`focus-change-warp-pointer' instead of focus-window when jumping
	to a focus.

	* group.scm: Added cascade windows to the group operations menu.

	* cascade.scm: Added `cascade-windows-interactively'; now needs
	window-selection and undo modules (since I call insert-undo-global
	before cascading)

Sun Feb 20 18:46:52 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window-configuration.scm: Refine `window-configuration?' test to 
	differentiate from arbitrary lists that have a car that is a
	window.

	* register.scm: Added `selected-windows-to-register',
	`list-of-windows?', `jump-to-register' to support saving and
	restoring window-selections in registers.

Sun Feb 20 18:29:18 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops-menu.scm: Have `make-menu-focus-options' use the
	window-context instead of get-window; fix bug that caused a
	get-window prompting during the display of the root menu when the
	focus submenu was supposed to pop up.

	* window-selection.scm: Use new `X-server-synchronize' instead of
	`handle-pending-events'.  Added `flash-selected-windows-on' to
	help out stylist.scm that manages windows at the flash-window
	level and messes up the display of the current selection.

	* stylist.scm: Added *style-list-flash-window-color* and make it
	yellow so that it's different from the color used for selected
	windows.   Call new `flash-selected-windows-on' after unflashing
	the news that the stylist affected.

	* reflection.scm: Added `interpret-as-procedure' to simplify
	handling of default argument to `where-is'

	* prompt-proc.scm: Use gtk-widget-grab-focus on the entry to make
	sure that the entry gets the focus at startup.  Avoid error if
	initval of a procedure is not given -- don't call procedure-name
	on #f.

	* placement.scm: Added auto-focus option;  hack it a bit using
	add-timer-hook! to run focus-change-warp-pointer after the
	placement is done.  And use new `focus-stack' module to provide
	`push-focus-window' that I call before focus-change-warp-pointer.
	Great effect w/ Netscape "Find" dialogs.

	* netscape.scm: Added #:auto-focus #t to "findDialog_popup"
	windows.

	* last-mapped-window.scm: Use focus-stack module and make
	`focus-last-mapped-window' have an optional push-focus? argument
	that causes the focus-window to be pushed if #t.

	* lambda-startup-logo.scm, flux-gtk.scm, ScwmButtons.scm: Use
 	X-server-synchronize instead of in-line expanding that function.

	* group.scm: Added option to select windows by title (in addition
	to by class, by resource, by single window).

	* base.scm: Added `X-server-synchronize' to do
	handle-pending-events after ensuring X-server synchronization.

	* animated-iconify.scm: Use a dynamic-wind to protect
	set-X-server-synchronize! calls.

	* where-is.scm, focus-stack.scm: Added

	* Makefile.am: Updated for above additions.

Sun Feb 20 15:13:55 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* stylist.scm, style.scm: Drop mention of #:random-placement,
 	#:smart-placement-- they're gone now.

	* minimal.scm: Added `standard-place-window' and initialize
	default-placement-proc to it, default-transient-placement-proc to
	null-place-window.
	
Sun Feb 20 12:21:51 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Moved hide-side-decorations, show-side-decorations
	here from style.scm.
	
	* style.scm: Use winops.scm, since it has
	{hide,show}-side-decorations, now.  Added option
	`debug-style-handler-applications' to help debug that stuff.
	Handle 'both style options correctly.  Eliminate
	vector-{first,second,third} since they were trivial definitions.
	Make no-side-decorations a 'both option, and no-titlebar works now 
	as a both option (i.e., it gets placed properly, and existing
	windows get updated)

	* style-options.scm: `make-bool-handler' and
	`make-property-handler' return procs that they give names to.

	* wininfo.scm: Make define-string-matcher a public macro

Wed Feb 16 19:20:10 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops-menu.scm: Added `window-applications-menu' and
	`set-window-applications-menu!' and added #:application-menu
	window style (now depends on style-options module).  Use the
	window-application-menu in the window ops menu, so use filter-list 
	to remove it if there is no application menu.

	* winops-menu.scm: Added `netscape-application-menu', and use it
	as an #:application-menu

	* winops-menu.scm: Make `filter-map' skip unspecified values,
	too (not just #f values).  Added `filter-list'.

Wed Feb 16 18:28:45 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am (scwm_common_scheme): Added easyraise.scm

	* base.scm: Make action procedures of menuitems interactive.

	* easyraise.scm: Added; an alternative to stays-on-top windows.

Sun Feb 13 09:53:25 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* minimal.scm: Added module-loaded-hook, call it from
	use-scwm-module-note-success.

Sun Feb 13 09:13:23 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Added interactive decl for
	`toggle-maximize-horizontal'.

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Reordered constraint classes to put
	strict-relative-position second, making it second from the right
	in the toolbar (next to anchor) since it is parameterized based on 
	where the click occurs, like the other 3 rightmost buttons.

	* auto-shrink.scm: Added some documentation.

Mon Feb  7 17:06:45 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Added auto-shrink.scm

	* auto-shrink.scm: A module that auto-shrinks windows that haven't
 	received the focus in a while.  Very alpha right now.  Inspired by
 	a paper that I've not yet read --- thanks to Tessa Lau for
	pointing me at it: http://www.elsevier.nl/gej-ng/10/23/72/31/29/27/abstract.html

Mon Feb  7 14:10:35 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am, auto-unobscure.scm: Added.  Do cool stuff on
	window-fully-obscured-hook;  implementation is a bit like
	auto-raise.scm.

	* flux.scm: Added `eval-expression-interactively',
	`resize-xdvi-full-page-100%'.

Mon Feb  7 10:00:04 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops-menu.scm: Switch close and destroy menuitems so close is
	the bottom-most one (since it is easier to get to using Shift-Down 
	to select the last item).

	* ui-constraints-composition.scm, ui-constraints-buttons.scm,
 	constraint-investigator.scm: ui-constraints-gtk-toggle-menu
 	changed to constraints-investigator.

Tue Feb  1 14:17:16 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* style.scm: Drop `deiconify-window' from the start-iconified
	window style;  when it's false, just do nothing.  This is perhaps
	the right behaviour, but also works around a bug in drawing ghost
	frames for iconified windows when restarting.  A better fix might
	change Deiconify() in window.c.

Wed Jan 26 16:50:44 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* placement.scm: Added `at-virtual-offset-placement'.

	* minimal.scm: Use immediate-proc for bind-mouse calls so that,
	e.g., the root-menu pops up more quickly.

Wed Jan 26 10:50:17 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* placement.scm: Added `at-vp-offset-placement'

Sat Jan 22 17:19:00 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* flux-gtk.scm: Added * to either end of
	`show-window-list-matching-interactively' so it does a regexp
	substring search by default.  Make `bookmark-grep' just do nothing 
	when no string is entered in the prompt.

Thu Jan 20 12:27:17 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* std-menus.scm: `execute-on-selection', `exe-on-selection' now
	use `X-handle-selection-string' instead of just using the cut
	buffer. 

	* netscape.scm: Added `netscape-av-search',
	`netscape-av-search-selection-url' for AltaVista searches.

	* flux-gtk.scm: Needs file and netscape modules.

Sun Jan 16 16:37:56 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am (scwm_gtk_scheme): Added gtk-table-display.scm

	* gtk-table-display.scm: Added, for formatting a text string into
	rows and columns of a table -- used by netscape-bookmark-search.

	* gtk.scm, prompt-proc.scm: Move some helper functions into (app
 	scwm gtk) module from prompt-proc.

	* flux-gtk.scm: Added `chop-string' and
	`netscape-bookmark-search', use gtk-table-display-module.

Sat Jan 15 15:18:10 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm, winlist.scm: Move window-list-proc into base.scm from
 	winlist.scm.  Reduces some circular dependency issues.

Sat Jan 15 12:38:56 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* netscape.scm: Fix bogus docs for `cgi-escapify-space'.

Wed Jan 12 00:28:56 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops-menu.scm: Added `make-menu-focus-options'

	* winlist-menu.scm: Added `show-netscape-window-list-menu'

	* placement.scm: Added `make-keep-winclass-centered'

	* flux-gtk.scm: ws change.

	* base.scm: Added `viewport-center-x', `viewport-center-y'

Tue Jan 11 18:15:39 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Make some fns interactive that weren't.

Tue Jan 11 18:09:47 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window-configuration.scm: Make `push-window-configuration',
	`pop-window-configuration' interactive.

	* shove-window.scm: Make shoving first push-window-position.

	* quote.scm: Added `quote-next-event', needs describe.scm to do so.

Tue Jan 11 13:27:53 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* netscape.scm (netscape-google-search): Let word == #f mean just
	go to google home page.  This better handles the case of no
	selection.

Tue Jan 11 09:30:39 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am, gtk-message.scm: Added.  Original version contributed by
	Francesco Tapparo -- thanks Francesco!

Mon Jan 10 17:09:47 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* fvwm-module.scm: Make `raise-fvwm2-pager', `lower-fvwm2-pager'
	interactive. 

Mon Jan 10 14:04:03 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* prompt-binding.scm: Change the way copy and insert work so that
	subsequent deletes delete the right row.  For some reason,
	delete's notion of the selected row didn't match with what was
	highlighted on screen.  The current situation is unsurprising, but 
	less than ideal, since a copy/insert leaves the copied line
	highlighted instead of switching to the copy of that line.

Mon Jan 10 13:16:33 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Document `bell'

Sun Jan  9 20:51:45 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* style.scm: Added more docs to `window-style', and let it take a
	list of '(ClassName ResourceName).

	* placement.scm: Added `auto-accept-dialog-placement'

	* netscape.scm: Added `enable-autosave-netscape-dialog',
	`disable-autosave-netscape-dialog'.  Use new format for
	window-style commands.  Eliminate top-level executive of
	window-style command.

Sun Jan  9 19:03:20 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* gtk.scm: Added `use-gtk-error-window-for-scwm' procedure, and
	have it use done-startup to ensure that the hooks aren't added
	prematurely.

	* base.scm: Remove adding procs to invalid-interaction-hook and
	cannot-grab-hook.  Define bell in terms of beep using a function,
	not in terms of the proc variables.

	* animation.scm: Use export, instead of (define-public foo foo)

Sun Jan  9 17:55:08 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* animated-iconify.scm: Fix `animated-deiconify-to-viewport' to
	just use `animated-deiconify' when the window is sticky.

Sun Jan  9 17:37:01 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xprop-extras.scm: Added `propagate-selection-to-cut-buffer'

	* netscape.scm: Parameterize selection stuff based on the
	selection, but have it default to "PRIMARY".  Added
	`netscape-google-search-selection-url'.

Sun Jan  9 17:21:52 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* modifier-key-bindings.scm: Added better comments, drop
	unbind-keycode-ignore-procs since that is now a capability of the
	primitive. 

	* fvwm-module.scm: ws change.

	* base.scm: `caught-error' need not be define*-public, just define-public.

Sun Jan  9 16:25:43 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xprop-extras.scm: Added `X-handle-selection-string' (nicer
	interface to `X-convert-selection' primitive).

	* winops.scm: Added some debug code to `maximize' and no longer
	reset gravity to 'northwest after a maximization.

	* netscape.scm: Added `netscape-goto-selection-url'.

	* bincomm.scm: Added some debugging code.

	* stringops.scm: Use base module for `color-property'.  Thanks
	Harald Meland!

Sat Jan  8 17:50:08 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* describe.scm: Added `describe-event', and factor out
	`display-binding' from all the `describe-*' procedures.  Also
	export `is-mouse-event?'

Sat Jan  8 17:15:09 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* prompt-proc.scm: Added helper procs
	`gtk-scrolled-window-set-vadjustment-value',
	`gtk-scrolled-window-set-hadjustment-value'

	* prompt-binding.scm: Get binding and unbinding to actually work.
	Use new `get-next-event' primitive to grab mouse and keyboard
	bindings.  Do some error checking.  Rename toplevel window to
	"Scwm Bindings" (was "Bindings")

	* base.scm: Added `caught-error' procedure for generating nice
	messages in error handlers.

Sat Jan  8 13:23:58 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* prompt-binding.scm: Make the Insert, Copy, Change, and Delete
	binding buttons dtrt to the binding clist, but still do not change 
	the actual bindings.  Added `clist-set-row-text' helper function.

Fri Jan  7 17:56:31 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* prompt-binding.scm: Use "Complex" instead of empty for the
	non-immediate mouse event type.  Added a middle pane (the bottom
	of the top pane, really) containing the current line for editing
	purposes. Make its set and grab buttons active.  Getting close to
	functional... 

Fri Jan  7 11:25:35 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* fvwm-module.scm: Added `raise-fvwm2-pager', `lower-fvwm2-pager'
	and rewrote `fvwm2-pager-window' to be a bit better.

Fri Jan  7 08:03:55 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* constraint-investigator.scm: Better alignment.

Fri Jan  7 07:58:14 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* time-convert.scm: Added msec->usec and sec->usec (for usleep,
	which still takes microseconds).

Wed Jan  5 15:51:54 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Added orientation option to
	two-window-or-more-nonant-prompter.  Change make-ui-cnctr-align's
	argument to a symbol from a string.

	* nonants.scm: Update `get-window-with-nonant-interactively' to
	respect the orientation and highlight whole edges for, e.g.,
	alignment constraints.

Wed Jan  5 12:46:59 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* constraint-investigator.scm: Make the enable/disable all
	constraints buttons draw all the constraints.  (makes it easier to 
	make the screenshot in the AAAI paper).

Tue Jan  4 16:41:41 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* base.scm: Added `set-highlight-colors!'

	* constraint-investigator.scm: Rearrange lines in the table-- put
	the checkbox at the far left.  Make the checkbox *and* the label
	both display the visualization of the constraint when hovered over 
	(using an event box).  Removed old `make-cn-button' private
	function that was not being used.

Mon Jan  3 09:25:33 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winops.scm: Set the window-list-proc to
	`focus-change-warp-pointer'. 

	* winlist.scm: Improve docs of `next-window'

Mon Jan  3 08:51:26 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ui-constraints-classes.scm: Highlight the current selected
	window.  GJB:FIXME:: this is a hack -- shouldn't effect
	*everything* like it currently does.

	* task-switcher.scm: Fix typo bug.

	* netscape.scm (netscape-google-search): Bug fix from Alexandre
	Duret-Lutz.  Thanks!
