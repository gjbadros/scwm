	* decor.scm: Added some basic support for decors: the
 	call-with-decor procedure and with-decor macro.

	* style.scm, style-options.scm, winlist.scm, winops.scm: Split
 	style.scm into styles.scm which provides the various style
 	commands and style-options.scm which provides the tables of style
 	options and hooks to add new ones. style.scm now does not need to
 	use every module that may define procedures that should be
 	available as style options; the files can just use the (app scwm
 	style-options) module and define relevant options themselves. This
 	was done for #:circulate-skip, #:circulate-skip-icon,
 	#:winlist-skip, and #:start-maximized.

	* style.scm: Change #:mwm-buttons from a style option to a hint
 	option.

Mon Oct 20 06:10:38 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* winlist.scm: Circulate (and therefore prev-window and
 	next-window) were giving an error when no window in the window
 	list satisfied the given conditions.  This is now fixed. Bug
 	reported by Jens-Ulrik Holger Petersen
 	<petersen@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp>.

	* wininfo.scm: in-viewport-any-desk? and visible? were not working
 	correctly when the viewport is away from 0,0; this is fixed. Bug
 	reported by Jens-Ulrik Holger Petersen
 	<petersen@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp>.

	* Makefile.in: Use mkinstalldirs to create the scwm scheme
 	directory if necessary.

	* wininfo.scm: wildcard-matcher: reversed the order of the if and
 	then clauses in (if full-regexp ...). Patch from Mikael
 	Djurfeldt <mdj@nada.kth.se>

Fri Oct 17 18:18:55 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* style.scm: The 'new-window and 'new-window-hint event handlers
 	were changes to call the old handler first and then execute the
 	style hooks.
	
	Also, the #:lenience style option was added.

	* base.scm: Fixed a bug in move-viewport - the let syntax was
 	incorrect. Bug report and fix from Holger Petersen
 	<petersen@kurmis.kyotou.ac.jp>

	* Makefile.in: Added VPATH support.
