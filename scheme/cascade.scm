  "Cascade WINDOWS according to several parameters.  
Cascading places the windows in a diagonal order starting at
START-POS, (0 0) by default. Each window's size is limited to
MAX-SIZE, by default the display size.

RESIZE may be #f, 'shrink-only or 'always, indicating that the windows
should never be resized, that they should be resized to the max-size
only if they are bigger, or that they should always be resized to the
max size. The default is 'shrink-only.

RAISE may be #f, #t, or 'restack-only, indicating that the windows
should not be moved in the stacking order; that they should be raised
on top of other windows and placed in the cascade order with the upper
left window lowest in the stacking order; or that they should be
restacked as for #t but not raised above other windows,
respectively. The default is 'restack-only.

X-INCREMENT may be an integer or a procedure that takes a window and
returns an integer, and which will be applied to a window to get the
horizontal offset for the next in the cascade order. The default is
the sum of the window's border width and title height.

Y-INCREMENT may be an integer or a procedure that takes a window and
returns an integer, and which will be applied to a window to get the
vertical offset for the next in the cascade order. The default is the
sum of the window's border width and title height."
