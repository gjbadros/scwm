;;;; auto-raise
;;;;
;;;; This module provides a convenient wrapper for the timer and
;;;; broadcast hook functionality to get auto-raise and similar
;;;; effects.  To get all your windows to do the default auto-raise,
;;;; just do the following:
;;;;
;;;;   (window-style "*" #:auto-raise #t)
;;;;
;;;; This will cause windows to be raise 300 milliseconds after they
;;;; get focus, unless they lose focus first.
;;;;
;;;; A slightly more complicated example:
;;;;
;;;;   (window-style "*" #:auto-raise #t #:auto-raise-delay 400
;;;;    #:auto-raise-focus-proc raise-window)
;;;;
;;;; You can also set a separate action to occur with a delay after
;;;; the window is unfocused. This action will be cancelled if the
;;;; window receives focus again before the timer times out. An
;;;; example:
;;;;
;;;;   (window-style "xterm" #:auto-raise #t #:auto-raise-delay 300
;;;;    #:auto-raise-focus-proc (lambda (w) (maximize 0 (%y 100) w))
;;;;    #:auto-raise-unfocus-delay 400 #:auto-raise-unfocus-proc unmaximize)
;;;;
;;;; This will make xterm windows that get focus become vertically
;;;; maximized with a 300 millisecond delay, and unmaximized 400
;;;; millisecnds after they lose focus.
;;;;
;;;; The unfocus delay defaults to be the same as the regular delay,
;;;; and the unfocus proc defualts to noop, that is, do nothing.
;;;;
;;;; Auto-raise probably works best with mouse or sloppy focus, since
;;;; it is based on the window getting focus, not on the window being
;;;; entered. That may change in the future.
