	* scwmcorba.c: Added, and moved everything into modules/corba
	since now the servant works from inside Scwm!

Sun Sep  5 19:52:32 1999    <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Added guard HAVE_GNOME_CORBA so this directory
	won't get in the way of typical builds.

	* scwm_scheme_evaluator-server.c: Major cleanup to isolate the
	essential bits-- removed unused code.

	* scwm_scheme_evaluator-impl.c: Re-indented (was autogenerated, so 
	was terribly formatted).

	* scwm-corba-exec.c: Use Exception function to catch
	errors. Rearrange argument checking.

Sun Sep  5 15:36:33 1999    <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* First version of scwm_scheme_evaluator interface + client +
	server.  The server currently does nothing but echo the expression 
	to evaluate.
