This is a library for dealing with Apple Macintosh files on Unix systems.

There are three different layers currently implemented.

At the lowest level are macbinary.c and applesingledouble.c.  These give 
interfaces to the common formats used for storing Macintosh files on
non-Macintosh computers - MacBinary, MacBinary II, MacBinary III,
Apple Single and Apple Double.

'Beside' that level is the resource.c level.  Given a memory buffer that
contains a Macintosh resource file, it allows retreiving resource data
by (type,id) pairs.  No interpretation of the data is done.

Above both of those is the applefile.[ch] level.  This gives a unified
(but currently less-featureful) interface to MacBinary, AppleSingle and
AppleDouble files, handles finding the resource file inside the file,
and exports the get_resource_by_id function.
