This is a voice recognition module for Scwm.

It uses IBM's ViaVoice.  I've only tested it on x86 GNU/Linux RH6, but
that may be the only platform that IBM's ViaVoice supports anyway.

Get the ViaVoice from IBM at:

http://www.software.ibm.com/speech/dev/sdk_linux.html

Grab the downloads and get it set up.  Be sure to follow the steps in
section 2 of /usr/doc/ViaVoice/rtreadme.txt including all the hoops
about setting up a user ID, etc. (steps 3, 4, and 5) as it won't
otherwise work.

Then reconfigure scwm (after updating from CVS) and double check that
include/config.h has HAVE_VIAVOICE #defined.  Then make all, and the
module should build.  You will need to be sure that the file
"modules/viavoice/scwmgrammar.fsg" is in the directory from which you
start Scwm (this will be fixed soon --09/16/99 gjb).

After starting scwm, do:

(use-scwm-modules viavoice scwmviavoice)
(vv-initialize)

And then start talking to Scwm!  Try saying, e.g.:

"move window left"

"move window right 100"

"move window north"


Enjoy!
