1998-10-18  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* pie-menus/draw-pie-menu.c: menu_look member added to pmdi; used
	to differentiate variations on pie menus.
	(InitGCs): MaskGC initialized;  one-time blocking done here, and
	call moved to CreateDynamicPieMenu
	(PaintDynamicMenu): inactive center only filled in in debug
	builds; I'm not sure which way I prefer. Made attempt at adding
	relief/shadow for circular window for circle-pie-menus; this
	doesn't work well. 
	(ConstructDynamicPieMenuInternal): renamed from
	ConstructDynamicPieMenu; second argument added, menu_look, for
	differentiating between variations.  first menu item's center is
	MENU_ITEM_START (90 degrees), not 0.  If menu_look ==
	circle_pie_menu_look, then keep track of smallest radius that will 
	include all the labels, and shape window into a circle this size.
	(ConstructDynamicPieMenu): New function with an old name; used for 
	creating rectangular-window pie menus
	(ConstructDynamicPieMenuShapeCircle): New function; used for
	creating circule-shaped pie menus
	(init_draw_pie_menu): added documentation for pie-menu-look; new
	menu look circle-pie-menu-look created

	* pie-menus/draw-pie-menu.c: quite a bit of general cleanup;
	#defines removed for things that are completely gone; // comments
	on removed structure members - either removed the line, restored
	the member, or changed to a proper C comment.  Variables renamed
	for consistency.  Edge coordinates and dx/dy added to pmidi to
	draw edge lines.  Edge lines drawn and center inactive circle
	filled in.  Border relieved.  'flyright' menus starting to be
	supported - InPopupZone still always returns False, but when
	popped up by key or time, tries to center on mouse.  Keyboard
	control basically works.  ConstrctDynamicPieMenu cleaned up quite
	a bit, but still needs to be factored out some more - it's way too
	long to be sure it's all right.  Variable-width items beginning to 
	be supported; separators are smaller than real items

1998-10-16  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* pie-menus/draw-pie-menu.c: moved from scwm.  First real
	implementation of pie menus.  The layout is still somewhat buggy,
	and several features are missing, but it basically works

	* pie-menus/Makefile.am: added file

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): added pie-menus

Thu Oct 15 08:01:57 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* overlay-plane/overlay-plane.c: Use GXcopy, not GXset for the GC
	function, and set the foreground color of the clear_gc to 0 before 
	trying to clear.  Still only partial success.

Wed Oct 14 11:08:46 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xpm-menus/draw-xpm-menu.c: Added comment re: removing #include
	libguile/dynl.h when guile-1.3 is released-- Blandy fixed
	libguile.h to do the include.

Sun Oct 11 15:19:32 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Added overlay-plane subdir

1998-10-10  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* xpm-menus/draw-xpm-menu.c (ConstructDynamicXpmMenu): enforce a
	minimum 4-pixel border width, like KDE; without this, some
	thin-border KDE themes didn't look right

Sat Oct 10 13:59:47 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xpm-menus/draw-xpm-menu.c: Added include of libguile/dynl.h
	(should guile's gh.h header include this through libguile.h?)

1998-10-07  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* xpm-menus/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): include proper include
	directories -- thanks to Craig Struble

	* xpm-menus/draw-xpm-menu.c: comments added to all the spacing defines;
	(PaintMenuItem): move right side of RR over one to improve
	appearance; move text right by half of MENU_TEXT_SPACING to
	improve appearance
	(InPopupZone): change popop zone from right 1/4 to right 1/2; something
	(ConstructDynamicXpmMenu): compute item width properly - was
	adding an extra MENU_ITEM_RR_SPACE

1998-10-06  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* xpm-menus/draw-xpm-menu.c: moved from scwm/;
	(PscwmFontForMenuItem): use scmFixedFont as last-ditch font default
	(ConstructDynamicXpmMenu): use DYNAMIC_SAFE_MENULOOK instead of
	MENULOOK, so scmMenuLook can be a symbol naming a menulook; if
	scmExtraOptions is a symbol, derefence it; if it still isn't a
	list, use the menulook's extra object isntead of the menu's; all
	together, allows easier global customization of menu looks
	(init_draw_xpm_menu): now static
	(scm_init_app_scwm_xpm_menus_module): new function, called to
	register the (app scwm xpm-menus) module
