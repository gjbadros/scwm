	* xpm-menus/draw-xpm-menu.c: Added comment re: removing #include
	libguile/dynl.h when guile-1.3 is released-- Blandy fixed
	libguile.h to do the include.

Sun Oct 11 15:19:32 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Added overlay-plane subdir

1998-10-10  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* xpm-menus/draw-xpm-menu.c (ConstructDynamicXpmMenu): enforce a
	minimum 4-pixel border width, like KDE; without this, some
	thin-border KDE themes didn't look right

Sat Oct 10 13:59:47 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xpm-menus/draw-xpm-menu.c: Added include of libguile/dynl.h
	(should guile's gh.h header include this through libguile.h?)

1998-10-07  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* xpm-menus/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): include proper include
	directories -- thanks to Craig Struble

	* xpm-menus/draw-xpm-menu.c: comments added to all the spacing defines;
	(PaintMenuItem): move right side of RR over one to improve
	appearance; move text right by half of MENU_TEXT_SPACING to
	improve appearance
	(InPopupZone): change popop zone from right 1/4 to right 1/2; something
	(ConstructDynamicXpmMenu): compute item width properly - was
	adding an extra MENU_ITEM_RR_SPACE

1998-10-06  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* xpm-menus/draw-xpm-menu.c: moved from scwm/;
	(PscwmFontForMenuItem): use scmFixedFont as last-ditch font default
	(ConstructDynamicXpmMenu): use DYNAMIC_SAFE_MENULOOK instead of
	MENULOOK, so scmMenuLook can be a symbol naming a menulook; if
	scmExtraOptions is a symbol, derefence it; if it still isn't a
	list, use the menulook's extra object isntead of the menu's; all
	together, allows easier global customization of menu looks
	(init_draw_xpm_menu): now static
	(scm_init_app_scwm_xpm_menus_module): new function, called to
	register the (app scwm xpm-menus) module
