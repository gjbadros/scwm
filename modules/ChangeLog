Sat Jun 24 14:13:03 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xlib-drawing/drawing.c (s_xlib_set_line_attributes_x): Notice if 
	sym_* are not set (using an assert).

Thu Feb 24 19:15:44 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* viavoice/scwmgrammar.bnf: Understand "move window center"

Sun Feb 13 09:51:30 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* */Makefile.am: Reordered to include more in automake conditional
 	so there aren't warning messages when attempting to build foo.x
 	when a module is chosen not to be built.

Sat Feb 12 20:18:30 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* */*.c: Use \n\ in docstrings.

Thu Jan 20 11:42:28 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* */*.c: Include "scwmconfig.h", not <config.h>

Wed Jan 12 00:02:10 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* viavoice/Makefile.am: Added scwmgrammar.fsg to EXTRA_DIST

Sun Jan  9 16:14:48 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* c-animation/c-animation.c (AnimatedResizeWindows): Permit a
	maximum of 100 steps in a window animation.  Make keypresses in
	the middle of an animation cause it to jump to the end, instead of 
	just stopping in the middle of the animation.  Added some
	debugging code.  Be sure that the *original* size of the windows
	is *always* used to compute the deltas within the iterations --
	ideally we would cache the values somewhere or build up an array,
	but there still isn't really a performance problem, so why
	bother.  (animated_resize_common) do not ComputePositionForResize
	before calling AnimatedResizeWindow, since the latter function
	does the gravity handling itself.  (This fixes bugs in animated
	maximization, e.g., that cause the window to wrongly move
	offscreen;  non-animated maximization worked fine before and still 
	does).

Sun Jan  9 16:13:15 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* make-devtest: Copy the files *after* removing the old files, so
	the inodes don't get re-used (thus letting running Scwm's that use 
	the old libraries keep running, and not crash after running this
	script).

2000-01-09  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* viavoice/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Would not find (generated)
	"scwmpath.h" if srcdir!=builddir.

Fri Dec  3 13:21:14 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* **/*.c:  Updated SCWM_*PROC and SCWM_*HOOK
 	macros to have docstrings as last argument instead of as a comment
 	just after the macro.

Thu Dec  2 09:23:02 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* viavoice/scwmgrammar.bnf: Added a comment about how to list
	productions using fsgenum.

Thu Nov 25 14:00:31 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* c-animation/c-animation.c (animate-windows): Added this
	primitive; rework others to use the new AnimatedResizeWindows().

Wed Oct 20 17:59:07 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmgtkhelper/scwmgtkhelper.c: Handle SIGINTs always so that the
 	focus is restored properly; change SCWM_CATCH_SIGINT to
 	SCWM_RESET_ON_SIGINT

Tue Oct 19 09:15:43 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmgtkhelper/scwmgtkhelper.c (s_restore_scwm_handlers): Only
	catch SIGINTs when SCWM_CATCH_SIGINT.

Sun Oct 17 10:09:58 1999    <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* c-animation/c-animation.c: Use SCWM_VAR_INIT for
	animation-delay.

Sat Oct  2 11:22:12 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* viavoice/scwmviavoice.c: Eliminated all compile-time warnings
	with egcs-2.91.66 and default flags.

Sat Oct  2 00:25:36 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* c-animation/c-animation.c (animated_resize_common): Permit w/h
	to be #f and let that mean use the current value.

Thu Sep 30 10:15:56 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* c-animation/c-animation.c (animated_resize_common): Only correct 
	for position on resizes when then destination position is given.
	Otherwise, let the correction for gravity take effect.  This fixes 
	the bug whereby `resize-halfscreen' was not honouring gravity
	since I made it use animated resizes.

Wed Sep 29 17:58:05 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* c-animation/c-animation.c: Fix non-north gravity bug in
	animated-resize-window, animated-resize-frame -- uses new
	ComputeDeltaForResize function.  Also eliminate the superfluous
	final move/resize calls after the animation... 

Tue Sep 28 08:33:02 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* proplist/scwmproplist.c: Switch from gh_{defer,allow}_ints() to
	scwm_{defer,allow}_ints().

Sun Sep 26 13:58:52 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* */Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Use new $(SCWM_SRC_DIR) so that
	-I../../src is used instead of -I../../scwm

Fri Sep 24 09:27:18 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xlib-drawing/drawing.c (xlib-set-drawing-mask!): Use XChangeGC
 	instead of creating a new GC.

Thu Sep 23 17:55:12 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xlib-drawing/drawing.c (s_xlib_set_drawing_mask_x): Do not
	create a new GC.

Mon Sep 20 23:46:44 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xpm-menus/draw-xpm-menu.c: Synch this up a bit with drawmenu.c.
	Maybe should drop drawmenu.c in favor of only this implementation, 
	and move the rest of the menuing code into a module (since gtk
	menus could be used instead).

Mon Sep 20 22:44:07 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* c-animation/c-animation.c (AnimatedResizeWindow): Make it use
	Cassowary throughout so the constraints are maintained during the
	move and resize.

Mon Sep 20 22:02:57 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* c-animation/c-animation.c: Lots of cleanup.  Drop
	AnimatedMoveWindow entirely and use the more general
	AnimatedResizeWindow even for animated moves.

Mon Sep 20 17:52:56 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* viavoice/Makefile.am: Install grammar file in
	scwm_viavoice_grammardir (e.g., /usr/share/scwm/ViaVoice/*).

Mon Sep 20 17:19:29 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xlib-drawing/drawing.c: Added sym_solid, sym_on_off_dash,
 	sym_double_dash, and make xlib-set-line-attributes! use them
 	instead of integers, and make its second argument option optional, 
	defaulting to 'solid.   Also update the default XOR value (drawing 
	mask) to use the 2^(display_depth) - 1 for better visibility.

Mon Sep 20 09:49:42 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* corba/Makefile.am: Move more targets into if/endif block so
	builds do nothing when corba is not enabled.  Thanks to Robert
	Chassell for the bug report.

1999-09-20  Jeff Nichols  <jwnichls@cs.washington.edu>

	* xlib-drawing/drawing.c: changed xlib-set-line-width! to
	xlib-set-line-attributes! and added the ability to change
	the line drawing format.

Sun Sep 19 16:12:01 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* viavoice/Makefile.am: Move BUILT_SOURCES into the if/endif so
	nothing gets exec'd when not HAVE_VIAVOICE.

Sun Sep 19 15:41:44 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* viavoice/scwmviavoice.c: Update documentation a bit.

Sat Sep 18 13:50:54 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* viavoice/scwmgrammar.bnf: Added lots of phrases.  Far more
	interesting a demo, now.

	* viavoice/scwmviavoice.c: Is now a pretty reasonable module. Use
 	validate.h, guile-compat.h.  Added *CB_proc variables to be used
 	for the asynchronous function calls.  These are *NOT* yet
 	complete.  Drop some C wrappers of the SmAPI, and just call the
 	SmAPI from the scheme primitives.  Wrote
 	`ScmAnnotationsFromRgAnnotations' for better reporting of
 	annotations.  Do argument validation on primitives.

Sat Sep 18 01:14:51 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xtest/scwmxtest.c, xpm-menus/draw-xpm-menu.c,
 	xlib-drawing/drawing.c, scwmgtkhelper/scwmgtkhelper.c,
 	proplist/scwmproplist.c, pie-menus/draw-pie-menu.c,
 	overlay-plane/overlay-plane.c, esdsound/sound.c,
 	corba/scwmcorba., c-animation/c-animation.c,
 	background/background.c, applefile/applefile.c:  Added
	guile-compat.h for UNSET_SCM, generally good to have.

Thu Sep 16 16:15:36 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* viavoice/README: Added note re: .fsg file.

	* viavoice/scwmviavoice.c: Added comments for primitives.

	* viavoice/scwmgrammar.bnf: Added focus switching, and random joke 
	text.

Thu Sep 16 13:09:32 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* viavoice/scwmgrammar.bnf: Added absolute movements, too, like
	"move window north west".

Thu Sep 16 12:10:58 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Added viavoice to SUBDIRS.

Thu Sep 16 11:27:01 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* viavoice/Makefile.am, viavoice/scwmgrammar.bnf,
	viavoice/scwmviavoice.c: Added -- simple interface to IBM ViaVoice 
	voice recognition technology!

Thu Sep  2 17:57:00 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* c-animation/c-animation.c: Drop some bogus code testing for
	startX < 0 (use #f instead).  Added ability of moving while
	resizing to AnimatedResizeWindow (can now drop AnimatedMoveWindow
	since the resize is fully more general).  Improve docs on
	animated-resize-{window,frame}.

Wed Sep  1 19:15:45 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmgtkhelper/scwmgtkhelper.c (ScwmGdkErrorHandler): Only call
	ScwmErrorHandler if gdk_error_warnings is set.  This avoids a
	spurious (and uninteresting) XShm_Attach BadAccess error from
	being displayed.

Wed Sep  1 10:27:07 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmgtkhelper/scwmgtkhelper.c (ScwmGdkErrorHandler): Added this
	function, and use it as the ScwmErrorHandler when gdk is loaded--
	it copies the error_code into the global gdk_error_code that gdk
	needs for some error testing.

1999-08-30  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* background/Makefile.am, c-animation/Makefile.am,
 	esdsound/Makefile.am, overlay-plane/Makefile.am,
 	pie-menus/Makefile.am, xlib-drawing/Makefile.am,
 	xpm-menus/Makefile.am, xtest/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Explicitly
 	mention include dir so that srcdir != builddir works.

Fri Aug 27 14:33:27 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xtest/Makefile.am, scwmgtkhelper/Makefile.am,
 	proplist/Makefile.am, esdsound/Makefile.am: Use HAVE_XTEST to
 	control whether scwm_module_LTLIBRARIES gets set (instead of
 	controlling whether directories are included in ../Makefile.am
 	since that was omitting directories from the distributino).

	* Makefile.am: Do not conditionally include sub directories--
	conditionally have those subdirectories have no targets. (That way 
	they are still in the distribution even if we don't have, e.g.,
	proplist installed).

Fri Aug 27 12:33:25 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* background/background.c (s_clone_resized_image): Use image, not
	uninitialized img.

Sat Jul 31 19:29:59 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xtest/scwmxtest.c: #include XTest.h.  Remove unused local variable.

Sat Jul 24 18:31:17 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* background/background.c (s_clone_resized_image): Renamed from
	`make-resized-image' to better match the `clone-scaled-image' name 
	in image.c.  Remove the legacy guile-1.2 crap with saving SCMs in
	a vector so they don't get collected.  Just use
	scm_permanent_object on some file-static variables.  Fix some bugs 
	I introduced to `set-background-image!' in my argument validation
	cleanup.

Sun Jul 18 16:29:28 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xtest/scwmxtest.c: Permit "delay" argument to be anything, and
	just do the delay iff the delay is really an integer. (This lets
	there be an extra bogus argument if we choose;  probably not worth 
	the workaround to avoid a set-cdr!, but the Scheme code for
	quoting is a bit nicer because of this).

Fri Jul 16 23:04:55 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xtest/Makefile.am, xtest/scwmxtest.c: Added XTest module
	wrapper.  Not complete, but it's got the important stuff.

Fri Jul 16 17:54:25 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Added XTEST_SUBDIRS (= xtest) iff HAVE_XTEST

Tue Jul 13 23:02:12 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* */Makefile.am: Added @PREFIX_INCLUDES to the INCLUDES parameter.

Fri Jul  9 08:56:47 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xlib-drawing/drawing.c (s_xlib_set_drawing_mask_x): Permit mask
	to be in [0,+Inf], not [0,255]

Mon Jul  5 19:59:22 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xlib-drawing/drawing.c: Permit 0 values for the width height
	arguments-- the iconification was sending 0s, and it seems
	harmless enough to let them go through (they do not cause X
	protocol warnings).

Mon Jul  5 17:17:16 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* background/background.c, proplist/scwmproplist.c,
	xlib-drawing/drawing.c: Use VALIDATE_XXX macros.

Fri Jul  2 22:25:22 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* proplist/scwmproplist.c: Largish cleanup of formal argument
	names and added brief documentation strings to all primitives.
	Some additional argument valiadation.  Still needs a good pass
	through it and some work at making it easier to use, I think.

Fri Jul  2 10:08:17 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* esdsound/sound.c (s_esd_reconnect): Doc fixes.

Mon Apr 26 15:07:48 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xpm-menus/draw-xpm-menu.c (ConstructDynamicXpmMenu): Make the
	  HLTextColor default to the menu text color when menu-hl-fg-color
	  is #f -- it was using black in error. (Same change as to
	  drawmenu.c a couple days ago).

Wed Apr 21 15:13:18 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* pie-menus/draw-pie-menu.c, xpm-menus/draw-xpm-menu.c: Use
 	XCursorByNumber instead of the Scr.ScwmCursors array.

Thu Apr 15 19:53:08 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Added PROPLIST_SUBDIRS, conditional on
 	HAVE_PROPLIST AM_CONDITIONAL.

Thu Apr 15 19:45:30 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* proplist/Makefile.am, proplist/scwmproplist.c,
 	proplist/proplistP.h: Added from Toby Sargeant.  Thanks Toby!
  	Some minor cleanup, significant interface enhancements
	(permit strings to be used as property lists transparently, and
 	return as strings transparently, more error checking, bug fixes,
 	etc.) by me before this commit.  Still not hugely tested, but this 
	could be really useful for reading other wm-s and gnome data
	structures from files.

Mon Apr 12 10:53:19 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xpm-menus/draw-xpm-menu.c: Made the rewrite changes as I did to
	drawmenu.c -- see it's ChangeLog in the last couple days.

Fri Apr  9 17:08:58 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xpm-menus/draw-xpm-menu.c: Honor menuitem font, bg, fg colors.
	Like changes to drawmenu.c.

Thu Apr  8 18:21:52 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* c-animation/c-animation.c: Fix the shaped window before animated 
	unshading (for squashed windows)

Wed Apr  7 10:22:03 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmgtkhelper/scwmgtkhelper.c: Handle SIGFPE, too.

	* xpm-menus/draw-xpm-menu.c, pie-menus/draw-pie-menu.c: Fix
 	spelling of highlight throughout.

Mon Apr  5 15:15:35 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmgtkhelper/scwmgtkhelper.c: Copy the
	newhandler/newhandler_doreset stuff out of scwm.c since it changed 
	there. Comment about the coupling.

Wed Mar 31 11:02:39 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xlib-drawing/drawing.c: Drop a bunch of gh_allow_ints() and
	redefer ints when they were of dubious need and obfuscated code.
	We need to revisit all of that stuff later, anyway.

	* */*.c: Use SCM_UNSPECIFIED, not SCM_UNDEFINED as the return
	value for side-effecting procs.  Use SCWM_WRONG_TYPE_ARG( instead
	of scm_wrong_type_arg(FUNC_NAME.

Tue Mar 30 18:47:51 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* background/background.c, c-animation/c-animation.c,
	xpm-menus/draw-xpm-menu.c:  Annotate formals with ARG_UNUSED to
	prevent some innocuous warnings.  Use VALIDATE_ARG_BOOL_COPY_USE_F 
	instead of COPY_BOOL_OR_ERROR_DEFAULT_FALSE

1999-03-29  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* esdsound/sound.c (s_esd_reconnect): Expanded the docs.

Mon Mar 29 20:47:52 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* c-animation/c-animation.c: Update to use new arg validation macros.

Mon Mar 29 08:17:00 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* c-animation/c-animation.c (s_animated_move_window): Fix default
 	to FALSE for 4th param to animated_move_window.

1999-03-28  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS, DIST_SUBDIRS): New directory "esdsound".
	* esdsound/sound.c, esdsound/Makefile.am: Added.

Sun Mar 28 18:18:27 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* c-animation/c-animation.c (s_animated_move_window): Fix bug --
 	was using virtual start position passed to AnimatedMoveWindow,
 	which was wrong.

Thu Mar 25 17:42:07 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* overlay-plane/get_color.c, pie-menus/draw-pie-menu.c: Drop some
 	unused variables, fix %d -> %ld in a printf.

Tue Mar 23 14:58:36 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmgtkhelper/scwmgtkhelper.c: Only call XConnectionNumber if
	gdk_display is non-null. Defensively protect against a gdk_display 
	that hasn't been set (but still will fail if it's corrupt or
	unitialized).

Thu Mar 18 09:05:41 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* overlay-plane/get_color.c: Added include config.h

Wed Mar 17 10:47:52 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* c-animation/c-animation.c: Added includes of decorations.h,
	resize.h to get some prototypes that were missing.

	* pie-menus/draw-pie-menu.c: Initialize some vars.

	* scwmgtkhelper/scwmgtkhelper.c (restore_scwm_handlers): Return
	SCM_UNSPECIFIED (was missing a return value previously).

	* xlib-drawing/drawing.c: Initialize a var that was warned about.

Wed Mar 10 20:02:11 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmgtkhelper/Makefile.am: Put @GTK_CFLAGS@ before @CFLAGS@ in
	case the order of -I options matters

	* */*.c: Removed extraneous #include of libguile/dynl.h that is no
 	longer needed in guile-1.3.

1999-02-11  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@alum.mit.edu>

	* c-animation/c-animation.c (AnimatedResizeWindow): Use viewport
	coordinates when resizing so things work OK in viewports other
	than (0 0).

	* c-animation/c-animation.c: Corrected `animated-window-shade' and
	`animated-window-unshade' primitives to send a
	`window-property-change-hook' notification. Added
	`animated-resize-window' and `animated-resize-frame' primitives.

1999-02-08  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@alum.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Only build in scwmgtkhelper directory
	conditionally.
	* scwmgtkhelper/Makefile.am: Don't try to conditionalize. These
	changes are for Automake 1.4 compatibility.
	
Sat Jan 23 16:33:16 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* c-animation/c-animation.c: Replace uses of iarg with literal
	numbers since they were buggy, and scwmdoc now does some checking
	on the numbers.

	* background/background.c:  Clean up argument mismatches, added /* 
	scope */ comment on bare brace

Sat Jan 23 14:23:27 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xlib-drawing/drawing.c (xlib_point_pair_p,
	xlib_point_pair_get_values): Added these functions.  Use point
	pairs for the various functions so that we don't need to decompose 
	point-pairs to use them for drawing.

Sat Jan 23 13:29:10 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xlib-drawing/drawing.c: 

Wed Jan 20 13:20:19 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xlib-drawing/drawing.c: Use scm_misc_error for out-of-range
	errors (not scm_wrong_type_arg);  doc string fixes; parenthesize
	multiplication and cast.

Wed Jan 20 11:00:21 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xlib-drawing/drawing.c, drawing.h: Simplify drawing.h -- needs
	no prototypes and is just a filler -- move its #includes into drawing.c

Wed Jan 20 10:44:02 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xlib-drawing/drawing.c: Changed name from set-drawing-mask! to
	xlib-set-drawing-mask!, updated some of the doc comments

	* scwmgtkhelper/scwmgtkhelper.c (s_scwm_gdk_X_fdes): Added doc comment

	* background/background.c (s_make_resized_image): Fix argument
	types -- "SCM" was missing so was defaulting to int.  Doc
	extractor caught this

	* xlib-drawing/*: Added. Largely written by Jeff Nichols-- thanks Jeff!

	* overlay-plane/overlay-plane.c: Make init_overlay_plane() static fn

Wed Jan 20 10:32:27 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Added xlib-drawing

Sat Jan  9 11:26:08 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* c-animation/c-animation.c: comment fixes -- make it clear that
	AnimatedMoveWindow works on viewport positions, and fix typo

Tue Dec 22 03:04:05 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Remove applefile and imlib, since they
 	don't build and/or are not in the repository.

1998-12-21  Todd Larason  <jtl@molehill.org>

	* xpm-menus/Makefile.am, scwmgtkhelper/Makefile.am,
	pie-menus/Makefile.am, overlay-plane/Makefile.am,
	c-animation/Makefile.am, background/Makefile.am: revert to
	installing in scwm_moduledir

	* scwmgtkhelper/Makefile.am: only install/uninstall if HAVE_GTK

Sat Dec 12 00:16:57 1998  Carl R. Witty  <cwitty@newtonlabs.com>

	* c-animation/c-animation.c (s_animated_window_shade): Eliminate
 	the fMaximized window flag.

	* background/background.c (s_set_background_color_x,
 	s_make_resized_image, s_set_background_image_x,
 	s_reset_background_x): Add docs.

	* c-animation/c-animation.c (s_animated_move_window): Update docs.

	* scwmgtkhelper/scwmgtkhelper.c (s_restore_scwm_handlers): Add
 	docs.

	* */Makefile.am: Use $(DESTDIR) in hand-written install-data-hook
 	rules (to match automake-generated install rules).

Sat Dec  5 11:19:30 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* c-animation/c-animation.c: #include a bunch of headers so that
	all the needed prototypes are seen

Fri Dec  4 22:37:42 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* applefile/Makefile.am, background/Makefile.am,
 	c-animation/Makefile.am, overlay-plane/Makefile.am,
 	pie-menus/Makefile.am, scwmgtkhelper/Makefile.am,
 	xpm-menus/Makefile.am: Fix rules for making the link.

Thu Dec  3 02:04:42 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* applefile/Makefile.am, background/Makefile.am,
 	c-animation/Makefile.am, overlay-plane/Makefile.am,
 	pie-menus/Makefile.am, scwmgtkhelper/Makefile.am,
 	xpm-menus/Makefile.am: Install dynamic link modules in pklibdir
 	instead of scwm_moduledir, and make the proper symlink in
 	scwm_schemedir. Better to keep modules all acessible in one
 	hierarchy.

	* background/background.c (set_background_color_x,
 	set_background_pixmap_x): set the properties that
 	esetroot/xsetroot/xpmroot/xloadimage set, and which eterm uses at
 	least some of to achieve the alpha transparency effect.

1998-11-22  Todd Larason  <jtl@molehill.org>

	* scwmgtkhelper/scwmgtkhelper.c (init_scwmgtkhelper): fix typo in
	name of scwmgtkhelper.x

	* pie-menus/draw-pie-menu.c: Support for a new menu-look,
	shaped-pie-menu-look -- thanks to Russell Nelson.

Fri Nov 20 02:01:00 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* scwmgtkhelper/scwmgtkhelper.c: New module with a few auxiliary
 	calls to help scwm work sanely when the guile-gtk module is
 	loaded.

	scwmgtkhelper/Makefile.am: Build it when we have Gtk+.
	
	* Makefile.am: Build in scwmgtkhelper subdir.

Tue Nov 17 18:35:01 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* pie-menus/draw-pie-menu.c, xpm-menus/draw-xpm-menu/c: eliminate
 	use of __FUNCTION__.

Sat Nov  7 16:21:55 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* background/background.c (reset_background_x): Added
 	`reset-background!' which should restore the default X background.

1998-11-03  Todd Larason  <jtlmolehill.org>

	* pie-menus/draw-pie-menu.c (PaintMenuItemLabel): fix renamed
	variables in I18N version; Thanks Shuji NARAZAKI!

1998-10-27  Todd Larason  <jtlmolehill.org>

	* applefile: added directory, and Makefile.am, README,
	applefile.[ch], applefile_int.h, applesingledouble.[ch], crc.h,
	macbinary.[ch], make_crc_table.c, resource.[ch].  It compiles, and 
	most of it works, not all of it's tested.  There's no guile
	interface yet, and the directory isn't in the Makefile to be
	compiled.

	* pie-menus/draw-pie-menu.c: use 0 units for separators; this is
	the best looking method I've found
	(ConstructDynamicPieMenuInternal): guard against divide-by-zero if 
	all the menu items are separators. It still won't work *well*, but 
	crashes aren't acceptable

Tue Oct 27 23:09:32 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* c-animation/c-animation.c: New loadable module to allow animated
 	moves and shades. All animation-related stuff from window.c and
 	move.c in the core was moved here. The new primitives are
 	`animated-move-window', `animated-window-shade',
 	`animated-whindow-unshade', and `set-animation!'. The animation
 	delay factor was moved to an `animation-delay' variable declared
 	here. Still needs variable and concept documentation, maybe
 	animated resizes, various flavors of animated iconify.
	
	* c-animation/Makefile.am: Build the c-animation module.

	* Makefile.am: Build new c-animation subdir. 

Thu Oct 22 05:45:16 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* background/background.c: New loadable module to set images or
 	colors as backgrounds. Use it as (app scwm background) and get
 	`set-background-color!' and `set-background-image!'.
  	`make-resized-image' is also provided; it is used internally by
 	set-background-image! to crop or uncrop the image if it is
 	centered rather than tiled.

	* background/Makefile.am: build setup stuff.
	
	* Makefile.am: Build new background subdir.

1998-10-18  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* xpm-menus/draw-xpm-menu.c (PaintMenuItem, PaintDynamicMenu,
	ConstructDynamicXpmMenu): look up images with DYNAMIC_SAFE_IMAGE
	so named will work as well as image objects

	* pie-menus/draw-pie-menu.c: menu_look member added to pmdi; used
	to differentiate variations on pie menus.
	(InitGCs): MaskGC initialized;  one-time blocking done here, and
	call moved to CreateDynamicPieMenu
	(PaintDynamicMenu): inactive center only filled in in debug
	builds; I'm not sure which way I prefer. Made attempt at adding
	relief/shadow for circular window for circle-pie-menus; this
	doesn't work well. 
	(ConstructDynamicPieMenuInternal): renamed from
	ConstructDynamicPieMenu; second argument added, menu_look, for
	differentiating between variations.  first menu item's center is
	MENU_ITEM_START (90 degrees), not 0.  If menu_look ==
	circle_pie_menu_look, then keep track of smallest radius that will 
	include all the labels, and shape window into a circle this size.
	(ConstructDynamicPieMenu): New function with an old name; used for 
	creating rectangular-window pie menus
	(ConstructDynamicPieMenuShapeCircle): New function; used for
	creating circule-shaped pie menus
	(init_draw_pie_menu): added documentation for pie-menu-look; new
	menu look circle-pie-menu-look created
	(MENU_PIE_BORDER): Leave more room around pie menus (6 pixels
	instead of 2)
	(struct MenuDrawingInfo_tag): include cpixSideImage and
	SideBGColor again
	(PaintSideImage): included again
	(PaintDynamicMenu): look up images with DYNAMIC_SAFE_IMAGE so
	named will work as well as image objects; paint side image if it's 
	configured
	(ConstructDynamicPieMenuInternal): support background image and
	(rectangular window style only) side image and side image background

1998-10-17  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* pie-menus/draw-pie-menu.c: quite a bit of general cleanup;
	#defines removed for things that are completely gone; // comments
	on removed structure members - either removed the line, restored
	the member, or changed to a proper C comment.  Variables renamed
	for consistency.  Edge coordinates and dx/dy added to pmidi to
	draw edge lines.  Edge lines drawn and center inactive circle
	filled in.  Border relieved.  'flyright' menus starting to be
	supported - InPopupZone still always returns False, but when
	popped up by key or time, tries to center on mouse.  Keyboard
	control basically works.  ConstrctDynamicPieMenu cleaned up quite
	a bit, but still needs to be factored out some more - it's way too
	long to be sure it's all right.  Variable-width items beginning to 
	be supported; separators are smaller than real items

1998-10-16  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* pie-menus/draw-pie-menu.c: moved from scwm.  First real
	implementation of pie menus.  The layout is still somewhat buggy,
	and several features are missing, but it basically works

	* pie-menus/Makefile.am: added file

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): added pie-menus

Thu Oct 15 08:01:57 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* overlay-plane/overlay-plane.c: Use GXcopy, not GXset for the GC
	function, and set the foreground color of the clear_gc to 0 before 
	trying to clear.  Still only partial success.

Wed Oct 14 11:08:46 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xpm-menus/draw-xpm-menu.c: Added comment re: removing #include
	libguile/dynl.h when guile-1.3 is released-- Blandy fixed
	libguile.h to do the include.

Sun Oct 11 15:19:32 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Added overlay-plane subdir

1998-10-10  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* xpm-menus/draw-xpm-menu.c (ConstructDynamicXpmMenu): enforce a
	minimum 4-pixel border width, like KDE; without this, some
	thin-border KDE themes didn't look right

Sat Oct 10 13:59:47 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xpm-menus/draw-xpm-menu.c: Added include of libguile/dynl.h
	(should guile's gh.h header include this through libguile.h?)

1998-10-07  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* xpm-menus/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): include proper include
	directories -- thanks to Craig Struble

	* xpm-menus/draw-xpm-menu.c: comments added to all the spacing defines;
	(PaintMenuItem): move right side of RR over one to improve
	appearance; move text right by half of MENU_TEXT_SPACING to
	improve appearance
	(InPopupZone): change popop zone from right 1/4 to right 1/2; something
	(ConstructDynamicXpmMenu): compute item width properly - was
	adding an extra MENU_ITEM_RR_SPACE

1998-10-06  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* xpm-menus/draw-xpm-menu.c: moved from scwm/;
	(PscwmFontForMenuItem): use scmFixedFont as last-ditch font default
	(ConstructDynamicXpmMenu): use DYNAMIC_SAFE_MENULOOK instead of
	MENULOOK, so scmMenuLook can be a symbol naming a menulook; if
	scmExtraOptions is a symbol, derefence it; if it still isn't a
	list, use the menulook's extra object isntead of the menu's; all
	together, allows easier global customization of menu looks
	(init_draw_xpm_menu): now static
	(scm_init_app_scwm_xpm_menus_module): new function, called to
	register the (app scwm xpm-menus) module
