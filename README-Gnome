Scwm works great with Gnome!

1) Install the RPMs (see RH6-notes for instructions for that platform)

2) Run the Gnome Control Center from your existing Gnome Desktop:
   Panel -> Settings -> Gnome Control Center

3) Select "Window Manager" under the "Desktop" subtree

4) Click "Add" in the top right of the control center applet

5) Enter (type what's in quotes below, omitting the quotes):

Name: "Scwm"
Command: "scwm"
Configuration command: "scwm-conf"

And click "Window manager is session managed" -- the default
system.scwmrc turns on session management using the `SM-register' function.

6) Click on the new scwm line in the list of window managers

7) Click on the "Try" button, and rid yourself of your old window manager forever!

ENJOY!
