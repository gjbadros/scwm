INSTALLING SCWM

Brief Installation Instructions ===========================================

To build Scwm on unix, there are two basic steps:

        1. Type "./configure", to configure the package for your system.
        2. Type "make", to build the package.

Generic instructions for configuring and compiling GNU distributions
are included below.  Use "./configure --help" to see configuration
options specific to Scwm.


What You Get ==============================================================

The `make' command builds several things: 

   - An executable file `src/scwm', which is the window manager program
     itself.

   - Two executables, `utilities/scwmexec/scwmexec' and
     `utilities/scwmrepl/scwmrepl

   - Various dynamically-loaded modules in lib/modules/*.so*

To install Scwm, type `make install'.  This installs the executable
mentioned above, as well as a system.scwmrc file, numerous guile
modules written in Scheme that provide additional window manager
commands, and the various dynamically-loaded modules.  It also installs
an Emacs mode for Scwm that'll go in $PREFIX/share/emacs/site-lisp/scwm.el.


What You Need =============================================================

To build this program, you need a working guile configuration.  In
particular, be sure that you use its built-in regular expression
support, not the "rx" library.  If you have librx.{a,so} in your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, guile's configure will find and use it.  To prevent
that, either change your LD_LIBRARY_PATH, rename librx.{a,so}, or edit
config.cache after running guile's configure but before doing the
make.  You need to edit the line that looks like:

ac_cv_lib_rx_main=${ac_cv_lib_rx_main='no'}
                                       ^^ be sure this is no

Scwm is tested with guile-1.3.4.

You also need the `sed' stream editor in your PATH, and a working GNU make.

Configuring guile `--with-threads' may be useful but is not currently required.

It is also highly recommended that you have GTK+-1.2 and GLib-1.2 built
and installed along with the guile-gtk wrapper of GTk+.

GTK+-1.2 is available from www.gtk.org
guile-gtk is available from www.ping.de/sites/zagadka/guile-gtk.
guile-gtk-0.17 is recommended, or you can use the CVS version of guile-gtk.
Use:

CVSROOT=':pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome' \
   cvs login
CVSROOT=':pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome' \
   cvs -z3 checkout guile-gtk

to get guile-gtk from CVS.

Other GNOME libraries, available from www.gnome.org, can be used by Scwm.
In particular, the imlib library available from www.gnome.org can be used
with Scwm instead of the xpm libraries; imlib's use results in some extra
functionality such as resizable images and better color palette sharing
behaviour.


Using SCWM Without Installing It =========================================

If you want to run scwm without installing it, copy the
sample.scwmrc/system.scwmrc file to your home directory as
.scwmrc. Then set the environment variable `SCWM_LOAD_PATH' to a
colon-separated list of directories, including the directory
containing this INSTALL file and the directory filled with the
modules' .so.* files.  There is a script, modules/make-devtest, that
creates a subdirectory modules/lib/ and fills it with symlinks and
copies the .so.* files from the various subdirectores of modules/.  You
should run the script after building all the modules, and again after
any of the modules change (e.g., if you are tracking CVS sources of
Scwm).

For example, suppose the Scwm distribution unpacked into a directory
called `$HOME/scwm-0.99.6' (so the full name of this file would be
`$HOME/scwm-0.99.6/INSTALL').  Then you might say

(for sh, Bash, Zsh, or other Bourne shell variants):

  export SCWM_LOAD_PATH=$HOME/scwm-0.99:$HOME/scwm-0.99.6/modules/lib

or (for Csh, Tcsh, or one of its variants):

  setenv SCWM_LOAD_PATH $HOME/scwm-0.99:$HOME/scwm-0.99.6/modules/lib

After copying the .scwmrc and setting SCWM_LOAD_PATH, you should be
able to run scwm out of the build directory without difficulty.  


Generic Instructions for Building Auto-Configured Packages ================

To compile this package:

1.  Configure the package for your system.  In the directory that this
file is in, type `./configure'.  If you're using `csh' on an old
version of System V, you might need to type `sh configure' instead to
prevent `csh' from trying to execute `configure' itself.

The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation, and
creates the Makefile(s) (one in each subdirectory of the source
directory).  In some packages it creates a C header file containing
system-dependent definitions.  It also creates a file `config.status'
that you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration.
Running `configure' takes a minute or two.

To compile the package in a different directory from the one
containing the source code, you must use GNU make.  `cd' to the
directory where you want the object files and executables to go and
run `configure' with the option `--srcdir=DIR', where DIR is the
directory that contains the source code.  Using this option is
actually unnecessary if the source code is in the parent directory of
the one in which you are compiling; `configure' automatically checks
for the source code in `..' if it does not find it in the current
directory.

By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
/usr/local/bin, /usr/local/lib, /usr/local/man, etc.  You can specify
an installation prefix other than /usr/local by giving `configure' the
option `--prefix=PATH'.  Alternately, you can do so by changing the
`prefix' variable in the Makefile that `configure' creates (the
Makefile in the top-level directory, if the package contains
subdirectories).

You can specify separate installation prefixes for machine-specific
files and machine-independent files.  If you give `configure' the
option `--exec_prefix=PATH', the package will use PATH as the prefix
for installing programs and libraries.  Normally, all files are
installed using the same prefix.

You may also need to use --with-guile-prefix if your guile headers are
not in /usr/include (e.g., --with-guile-prefix=/uns if guile headers are 
in /uns/include).

`configure' ignores any other arguments that you give it.

If your system requires unusual options for compilation or linking
that `configure' doesn't know about, you can give `configure' initial
values for some variables by setting them in the environment.  In
Bourne-compatible shells, you can do that on the command line like
this:
        CC='gcc -traditional' DEFS=-D_POSIX_SOURCE ./configure

The `make' variables that you might want to override with environment
variables when running `configure' are:

(For these variables, any value given in the environment overrides the
value that `configure' would choose:)
CC              C compiler program.
                Default is `cc', or `gcc' if `gcc' is in your PATH.
INSTALL         Program to use to install files.
                Default is `install' if you have it, `cp' otherwise.
INCLUDEDIR      Directory for `configure' to search for include files.
                Default is /usr/include.
PERL            Path to Perl v5.0.x

(For these variables, any value given in the environment is added to
the value that `configure' chooses:)
DEFS            Configuration options, in the form '-Dfoo -Dbar ...'
LIBS            Libraries to link with, in the form '-lfoo -lbar ...'

If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, we encourage
you to teach `configure' how to do them and mail the diffs to the
address given in the README so we can include them in the next
release.

2.  Type `make' to compile the package.

3.  Type `make install' to install programs, data files, and
documentation.

4.  You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
source directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
Makefile(s), the header file containing system-dependent definitions
(if the package uses one), and `config.status' (all the files that
`configure' created), type `make distclean'.

The file `configure.in' is used as a template to create `configure' by
a program called `autoconf'.  You will only need it if you want to
regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.
