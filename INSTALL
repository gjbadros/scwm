Brief Installation Instructions ===========================================

To build scwm on unix, there are several steps:

	0. (prerequisite) - make sure you have guile installed (preferrably
	   configured --with-threads).

	1. Edit Scwm.tmpl to set up some directories - you will need to set
	GuilePrefix to whatever --prefix was used when you compiled Guile -
	probably /usr/local or /usr. I have set the default to /usr/local.
	There are several directories, ScwmBinDir, ScwmDir, ScwmlibDir,
	and ScwmManPath that you may wish to change if you do not like
	imake's default behavior. Finally, you will want to remove -lqt
	from the GUILE_LIBRARIES line if your guile does not have thread 
	support.
	
	2. Type "xmkmf" to configure the package.
	3. Type "make Makefile"
	4. Type "make Makefiles"
	5. Type "make all"

Yes, this build process sucks beyond belief. Autoconf and Automake
will replace imake as the configuration/build utilities as soon as
possible, and then you'll be able to do "./configure; make" as with
any autoconf-configured program.

What You Get ==============================================================

The `make' command builds several things: 

   - An executable file `scwm/scwm', which is the window manager
program itself.

   - An object library `libs/libscwm.a', which is an artifact of the
olf fvwm2 build process and will probably go away soon.

To install Scwm, type `make install'.  This installs the executable
mentioned above, as well as a system.scwmrc file and several guile
modules written in Scheme that provide additional window manager
commands. Overall, if everything is installed in the default place,
you will probably end up with something like:

{these go wherever imake thinks they should} 
/usr/X11R6/bin/scwm
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/scwm/system.scwmrc

{these depend on the location of guile}
/usr/local/share/guile/app/scwm/base.scm
/usr/local/share/guile/app/scwm/optargs.scm
/usr/local/share/guile/app/scwm/wininfo.scm
/usr/local/share/guile/app/scwm/winlist.scm
/usr/local/share/guile/app/scwm/winops.scm



Using SCWM Without Installing It =========================================

If you want to run scwm without installing it, copy the
sample.scwmrc/system.scwmrc file to your home directory as
.scwmrc. Then set the environment variable `SCHEME_LOAD_PATH' to a
colon-separated list of directories, including the directory
containing this INSTALL file.

For example, suppose the Guile distribution unpacked into a directory
called `/home/mstachow/scwm-0.1' (so the full name of this file would be
`/home/mstachow/swm-0.1/install').  Then you might say:

  export SCHEME_LOAD_PATH=/home/mstachow/scwm-0.1

if you're using Bash or any other Bourne shell variant, or

  setenv SCHEME_LOAD_PATH /home/mstachow/scwm-0.1

if you're using CSH or one of its variants.

After copying the .scwmrc and setting SCHEME_LOAD_PATH, you should be
able to run scwm out of the build directory without difficulty.
