Scwm @VERSION@ is released.

* What Scwm is:

Scwm is the Scheme Constraints Window Manager, a highly dynamic and
extensible window manager for the X Window System.  Scwm embeds Guile
Scheme as the configuration and extension language, and includes a
sophisticated constraint solver for permitting the user to interactively
specify constraints among top-level window sizes and positions.  Nearly
all decorations can be changed at run-time on a per-window basis.
Dynamic loading of C modules is supported.  Scwm is self-documenting and
provides A powerful protocol for interacting with the window manager
from other processes.

ftp://scwm.mit.edu/pub/scwm/scwm-@VERSION@.tar.gz

There is also
ftp://scwm.mit.edu/pub/scwm/scwm-icons-@VERSION@.tar.gz

which has a number of images for use with scwm as icons, textures,
buttons, etc. Some of these images are not available otherwise.

You will also need to download and install the guile library. You can
get the latest release from:

ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/guile

or any archive that has GNU source packages available.  Guile 1.3.4 is
recommended because all testing by the developers is done against 
that version, the latest stable release of Guile. Guile 1.2 is no longer
supported, but Guile-1.3 may still work with only minimal loss of
functionality (Guile-1.3.2 was buggy and should be avoided).
