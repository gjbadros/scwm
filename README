SCWM 0.7

This is a beta release of SCWM, the Scheme Configurable Window
Manager. 

SCWM descends from fvwm2 and replaces its ad-hoc configuration language
with Guile Scheme. It supports virtually all fvwm2 functionality (module 
support is still alpha-quality), and is far more powerful thanks
to the embedded Scheme interpreter, and all its features and libraries.

Other additional features scwm provides are:

 o sophisticated window decoration system
 o flexible menu system, permitting dynamically loadable 
   menu drawing primitives
 o animated window movements
 o animated window shading
 o synthetic key press events (no more mouse needed to click on
   URLs in netscape!)
 o an interactive read-eval-print loop (repl)
 o scwmexec, and scwm.el, for interactively evaluating and testing
   new window manager functions from your shell or within emacs

This release, although labelled beta, should be pretty stable and
moderately useful. Numerous individuals have reported using SCWM 
as their main window manager for several months.  We make every effort
to eliminate segmentation faults and other bugs, but make no guarantees
-- use at your own risk, as always.

SCWM builds on i386-unknown-linux, sparc-sun-solaris, mips-sgi-irix, and
generally any platform where both fvwm2 and guile will build.  Note that
we recommend using recent developer's snapshots of guile until guile 1.3
is released (guile 1.2 may work with some tweaking). See the file
INSTALL for further instructions.

There's various kinds of documentation and random info in the doc
directory, and you can see some examples of what might be done in the
startup files included in the sample.scwmrc/ directory.  Also consider
browsing the SCWM modules in the scheme/ directory.

Things to look for in the near future include: more cleaning up of the
leftover fvwm-isms in the code, restruccturing of the internal data
structures, a more complete external interface, and a start on
integrating guile-gtk and/or guile-tk so that you can create your own
arbitrary gui elements.  We are also working on adding a window layout
constraint solver to SCWM; stay tuned for details, as this should be one 
highly nifty feature!

The copyright for the code in the SCWM and libs subdirectories is the
fvwm copyright, which may be found in COPYING.FVWM. Several files may
have a slightly different copyright, or be under our copyright. The
files in the scheme directory are under GPL (see scheme/COPYING). The
files in the doc directory are all under the copyright specified by
doc/COPYRIGHT.DOC.
