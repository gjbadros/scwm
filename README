Scwm, The Scheme Configurable Window Manager.

(See additional specialty documentation in the sub-directory "doc/")

Scwm is a dynamic and extensible window manager and X11 scripting
facility based on Guile Scheme.  It descends loosely from fvwm2 and
supports virtually all fvwm2 functionality (module support is still
only beta-quality), and is far more powerful thanks to the embedded
Scheme interpreter, and all of its features and libraries.

Other additional features scwm provides are:

 o sophisticated window decoration system
 o integrated interaction and documentation system 
   (Emacs or readline based)
 o integration with guile-gtk widget bindings
 o extensible window manager hooks, placement procedures,
   and more to provide the ultimate in behaviour configurability
 o flexible menu system, permitting dynamically loadable 
   menu drawing primitives (alpha)
 o animated window movements, and shading
 o synthetic key press events (no more mouse needed to click on
   URLs in netscape!)
 o beta-quality optional constraint-based window layout
   (see README-constraints for more details and
    see http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/constraints/cassowary/
    for information about the solver)

This release, although labeled beta, is reasonably stable and
exceedingly useful.  Many individuals, including the developers, have
been using Scwm as their primary window manager for several months.  We
make every effort to eliminate segmentation faults and other bugs, but
make no guarantees -- use at your own risk, as always.

Scwm builds on i386-pc-linux, i386-pc-freebsd, sparc-sun-solaris,
mips-sgi-irix, and generally any platform where both fvwm2 and guile
will build.  We recommend using guile-1.3 currently. See the file
INSTALL for further instructions.

There's various kinds of documentation and random info in the doc
directory, and you can see some examples of what might be done in the
startup files included in the sample.scwmrc/ directory.  Also consider
browsing the Scwm modules in the scheme/ and the example/test code in
the scheme/tests/ directory.  See doc/scwm-intro-tutorial.scm for 
a basic introduction to Scwm, Scheme, and means for interacting with
and customizing your Scwm environment.

Things to look for in the near future include: an event-binding system
rewrite, better support for the Cassowary constraint solving toolkit,
better support for using guile-gtk (and perhaps support for guile-tk),
dynamically loadable primitives (separating Scwm into smaller pieces for
a leaner memory footprint), and much much more.

The copyright for the code in the Scwm and libs subdirectories is the
fvwm copyright, which may be found in COPYING.FVWM. Several files may
have a slightly different copyright, or be under our copyright. The
