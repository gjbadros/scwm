This is an alpha release of scwm, the Scheme Configurable Window
Manager.  It doesn't even implement all the useful fvwm functions
right now. It's just here as a proof of concept. I've only tried
compiling it on i386-unknown-linux, but any platform that both fvwm
and guile will build on should work. You need to have guile installed
to do the build, and then just 

xmkmf
make Makefile
make Makefiles
make all


You could "make install" after that in theory, but I'd reccommend just
copying the sample.scwmrc/system.scwmrc to your homedir as .scwmrc and
running it from wherever it gets compiled, rather than have junk on
your system that it might be annoying to get rid of.

There's various kinds of documentation and random info in the do
directory, and you can see some examples of what might be done in the
system.scwmrc.

However, the system.scwmrc is not very interesting right now. If you
think of neat hacks for it, pass them along to me. When I'm done
making this release I'm going to work on sticking everything in a CVS,
so if people even want to work on the windowmanager itself, that's
cool.
