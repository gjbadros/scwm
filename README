SCWM 0.2

This is an alpha release of scwm, the Scheme Configurable Window
Manager. SCWM is (currently) a hack of FVWM 2 with the fvwm
configuration language replaced with Guile Scheme. Eventually, it will
support many new features enabled by the powerful configuration
language, including a GUI on-the-fly setup. I also think I can
eventually get the base binary smaller than fvwm2's, by removing the
redundant functionality and replacing it with simpler primitives, and
also by placing some features in dynamically loadable shared libraries.

This third alpha release implements nearly all useful fvwm2 functions,
and fixes some of the bugs from the last release. The only major
functionality still missing is: the button, title and border style
commands, all of the decor commands, and everything related to
modules. FVWM Modules will probably never be implemented, because I
have better ways to provide similar functionality. The other style
stuff and Decors will be supported in the near future. An interactive
repl is available through the -i command-line option. This release,
although labelled alpha, should be pretty stable and moderately
useful. I've regularly used scwm as my window manager for about a
month now.

I've only tried compiling it on i386-unknown-linux, but any platform
that both fvwm2 and guile will build on should work. You need to have
guile installed to do the build. See the file INSTALL for further
instructions.

There's various kinds of documentation and random info in the doc
directory, and you can see some examples of what might be done in the
system.scwmrc, and also looking at the modules in the scheme directory.

However, the system.scwmrc is not very interesting right now. If you
think of neat hacks for it, pass them along to me. If people even want
to work on the windowmanager itself, that's cool too.

Things to look for in the near future include: a start on cleaning up
the many leftover fvwm-isms in the code, more style and decor stuff,
and a start on integrating guile-gtk so that you can create your own
arbitrary gui elements.

The copyright for the code in the scwm and libs subdirectories is the
fvwm copyright, which may be found in COPYING.FVWM. Several files may
have a slightly different copyright, or be under my copyright. The
files in the scheme directory are under GPL (see scheme/COPYING). The
files in the doc directory are all under the copyright specified by
doc/COPYRIGHT.DOC.
