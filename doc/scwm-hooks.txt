after-change-desk-hook (2 args)
- 
This hook is invoked whenever the current desktop is changed.
It is called with two argument, both integers.  The first is the
new desktop number, the second is the old desktop number.  It
is called after the desk is changed. See also `change-desk-hook'.
[From src/virtual.c:51]


after-new-window-hook (1 args)
- 
This hook is invoked after a window is created and placed.
Its procedures are each called with a single argument, WIN, the new window.
Any window operations may be performed at this time. However, it is
recommended that placement-related operations, such as setting the
position, desk, viewport location and z-ordering of a window be done
in the placement procedure instead.  It should be used for setting
window styles, as the window geometry needs to be fully and correctly
specified before the window is placed.  The `window-style' mechanism
from the "(app scwm style)" module provides a convenient interface to
setting the relevant parameters when a new window is created. 

See also `before-new-window-hook' and `before-place-new-window-hook'.
[From src/add_window.c:129]


before-new-window-hook (1 args)
- 
This hook is invoked when first creating a new window object.
Its procedures are each called with a single argument, WIN, the new
window.  Only a subset of the usual window parameters should be set
here, in particular, those that control what hints will be respected
for this window, and those that control how the window will be placed.

This hook does not typically need to be used directly by the user;
`window-style' from the "(app scwm style)" module provides a convenient
interface to setting the relevant parameters when a new window is
created.

See also `before-place-new-window-hook' and `after-new-window-hook'. 
[From src/add_window.c:106]


before-place-new-window-hook (1 args)
- 
This hook is invoked just before placing a new window.
It comes after `before-new-window-hook', but before `after-new-window-hook'. 
Its procedures are each called with a single argument, WIN, the new window.
This hook may be removed later since it is mostly redundant with the other
two hooks, despite being invoked at a slightly different time. 

See also `before-new-window-hook' and `after-new-window-hook'.

has processed the scwmrc and captured all application windows, and
right before it enters the main event loop.  Note that during
processing of the .scwmrc startup file, windows have not already been
captured, so the window-list (as reported by `list-all-windows') is
empty.  To provide behviour conditioned on a property of an existing
window, this hook should be used instead.

[From src/events.c:191]


window-partially-obscured-hook (1 args)
- 
Invoked when window receives a VisibilityPartiallyObscured
event.  The hook procedures are invoked with one argument, the window
object of the window that is now partially obscured.  Beware that this
event happens more often than you might expect and an action procedure
attached here should be very careful about manipulating windows in a way
that might cause more Visibility events.
[From src/events.c:201]


window-property-change-hook (4 args)
- 
This hook is invoked whenever a window property changes.
The hook procedures are invoked with four arguments, the window whose

window-unobscured-hook (1 args)
- 
Invoked when window receives a VisibilityUnobscured event.
The hook procedures are invoked with one argument, the window object
of the window that is now fully visible. Beware that this

X-ConfigureRequest-hook (6 args)
- 
This hook is invoked upon ConfigureRequest events.
The arguments are: '(win icon? x y width height) where win
is the window requesting the configuration change, icon? is #t
iff that window's icon is requesting the change, x, y, width,
and height are either integers or #f to indicate that that
aspect was not part of the configure request event. 
If `configure-request-handled' is #t after execution of the
hook procedures, then no C-level handling of the request
will be performed.

It indicates a window was destroyed.  The hook procedures are
invoked with one argument, WINID, the X id of the window that was destroyed. 
This hook is invoked for both the client window and the window frame
IDs (i.e., twice per top-level window).  You probably want to use
`window-close-hook' or `X-UnmapNotify-hook' instead.
[From src/events.c:160]


X-MappingNotify-hook (0 args)
- 
This hook is invoked whenever a MappingNotify X event is
received. A MappingNotify event indicates a change of keymapping - in

buttons. The hook procedures are invoked with no arguments.

X-PropertyNotify-hook (2 args)
-

procedures are invoked with two arguments, the name of the property
that changed (as a string) and the window that it changed for.
[From src/events.c:135]


X-root-PropertyNotify-hook (2 args)
- 
This hook is invoked whenever a PropertyNotify event is received
on the root window.  This indicates that an X window
property has changed. Watching for window property changes can be used
to construct your own custom window manager protocols, or interface
to other desktop environments such as KDE or GNOME. The hook
procedures are invoked with two arguments: the atom for the changed
property and a boolean telling whether the property was deleted. 
These arguments are different from those passed to
X-PropertyNotify-hook's procedures.
[From src/events.c:143]


X-UnmapNotify-hook (1 args)
- 
This hook is invoked upon UnmapNotify X events.  It indicates a
window is being unmapped (removed from display).  The hook procedures
are invoked with one argument, WIN, the window being destroyed.  The
WIN is still valid during the hook procedures.
