after-new-window-hook (1 args)
- 
This hook is invoked after a window is created and placed.
Its procedures are each called with a single argument, WIN, the new window.
Any window operations may be performed at this time. However, it is
recommended that placement-related operations, such as setting the
position, desk, viewport location and z-ordering of a window be done
in the placement procedure instead.  It should be used for setting
window styles, as the window geometry needs to be fully and correctly
specified before the window is placed.  The `window-style' mechanism
from the "(app scwm style)" module provides a convenient interface to
setting the relevant parameters when a new window is created. 

See also `before-new-window-hook' and `before-place-new-window-hook'.

before-new-window-hook (1 args)
- 
This hook is invoked when first creating a new window object.
Its procedures are each called with a single argument, WIN, the new
window.  Only a subset of the usual window parameters should be set
here, in particular, those that control what hints will be respected
for this window, and those that control how the window will be placed.

This hook does not typically need to be used directly by the user;
`window-style' from the "(app scwm style)" module provides a convenient
interface to setting the relevant parameters when a new window is
created.

See also `before-place-new-window-hook' and `after-new-window-hook'.

before-place-new-window-hook (1 args)
- 
This hook is invoked just before placing a new window.
It comes after `before-new-window-hook', but before `after-new-window-hook'. 
Its procedures are each called with a single argument, WIN, the new window.
This hook may be removed later since it is mostly redundant with the other
two hooks, despite being invoked at a slightly different time. 

See also `before-new-window-hook' and `after-new-window-hook'.
