To build the html pages (i.e., for "make html") you need
JADE (JAmes's DSSSL Engine) and the 
DocBook DTD (Document Type Defintion) and html stylesheet.

***All the software is available under "complementary links" from
the scwm web page.

What follows are possibly outdated notes about where to find
related information.

JADE is available from:

http://www.jclark.com/jade/

DocBook is available from:

http://www.oreilly.com/davenport/


Note that JADE uses the environment variable SGML_CATALOG_FILES
to find out where the entities catalog is.  You'll need to 
set that variable to point at a catalog file that you add
pointers to various entities in.

Some of the entities files may not be included in the two above
sites.  The W3C page also has some useful pointers and files:

http://www.w3c.org

As an alternative, the SGMLtools bundle should contain all of the
above, nicely integrated.  Be sure to have a recent version (>=2.0).
It's available from:

http://www.sgmltools.org/

Other useful pointers include:

and:

http://www.gnome.org/devel/docs.shtml

Improvements to this documentation are appreciated.  

Good luck,
Greg
