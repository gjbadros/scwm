To build the html pages (i.e., for "make html") you need
JADE (JAmes's DSSSL Engine) and the 
DocBook DTD (Document Type Defintion) and html stylesheet.

JADE is available from:

http://www.jclark.com/jade/

DocBook is available from:

http://www.oreilly.com/davenport/


Note that JADE uses the environment variable SGML_CATALOG_FILES
to find out where the entities catalog is.  You'll need to 
set that variable to point at a catalog file that you add
pointers to various entities in.

Some of the entities files may not be included in the two above
sites.  The W3C page also has some useful pointers and files:

http://www.w3c.org

Other useful pointers include:

http://www.egr.msu.edu/Pgrt/

and:

http://www.gnome.org/devel/docs.shtml

Improvements to this documentation are appreciated.  I'm a novice, 
and got this working a while back after a bit of effort -- unfortunately 
I can no longer remember the details, and cannot seem to find any
more notes on what I did.

Good luck,
Greg
