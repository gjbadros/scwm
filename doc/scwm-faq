* How do you pronounce Scwm?

Some spell it out: "Ess See Double-you Emm", others pronounce it as
an acronym "squim" or "skwim" rhyming with "whim" starting with the
"squ" as in "squat".


* How can I convert by .fvwm2rc to a .scwmrc?

Unfortunately, right now there are no automatic tools for doing the
conversion (we'd love to see someone contribute such a thing).  A more
complete answer is that you probably do not want to directly convert
your .fvwm2rc to a .scwmrc because Scwm permits so much greater
abstraction and programmability that a simple conversion is likely to
not be a very good .scwmrc.

We recommend that you take one of the existing .scwmrc files from the
sample.scwmrc/ directory, and modify it to suit your needs.  We are
working for easier-to-use GUI configuration tools, but they are not yet
in place.
