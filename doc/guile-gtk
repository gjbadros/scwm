Scwm now has *EXPERIMENTAL* level support for guile-gtk. Do not use
this unless you know what you are doing - your window manager might
get killed under certain unsafe operations. 

* Right now, the only one I know about is that doing a
`destroy-window', so make absolutely sure you "Close" or "Delete"
scwm-gtk windows rather than "Destroy"ing them.

If you do want to write code that uses gtk with scwm, make sure you
use both of the modules (app scwm gtk) and (gtk gtk) in that order.

This code has only been tested with gtk+-1.0.6 and guile-gtk-0.12 so
far.
