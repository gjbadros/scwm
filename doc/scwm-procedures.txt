(add-input-hook! port proc)
Add a timer hook; whenever input becomes availabe on PORT,
procedure PROC will be called with no arguments repeatedly until no
unprocessed input remains on PORT. PORT must be open, it must be an
input port, and it must be a file port (this includes pipes and
sockets, but not string ports or soft ports). A handle suitable for
passing to `remove-input-hook!' is returned.
[From scwm/callbacks.c:567]


(add-timer-hook! usec proc)
Add a timer hook; when at least USEC microseconds have

currently has a normal border. WIN defaults to the window context in
the usual way if not specified.
[From scwm/window.c:2700]

during initial startup, or during a recapture operation. In either
case, placement procedures should probably avoid interaction and
perhaps avoid moving the window being placed at all.
[From scwm/miscprocs.c:179]


(clear-color-cache-entry name)
Colors are cached by name. It is remotely possible that the
meaning of a particular string as a color will change in your X
server, if you try hard enough. For this unlikely eventuality,
`clear-color-cache-entry' is provided - it removes the color
associated with NAME from the color cache.
[From scwm/color.c:186]


(clear-font-cache-entry name)
Fonts are cached by name. It is remotely possible that the
meaning of a particular string as a fonts will change in your X
server, if you try hard enough (perhaps if you add or remove font
servers). For this unlikely eventuality, `clear-font-cache-entry' is
provided - it removes the font associated with NAME from the font
cache.
[From scwm/font.c:378]


(clear-image-cache-entry name)
Images are cached by both name and full pathnme. It is
remotely possible that the file that should be used for a particular
name will change, for example if you alter the image file or change
your image path. For this unlikely eventuality,
`clear-image-cache-entry' is provided - it removes the image
associated with NAME from the image cache.
[From scwm/image.c:552]


(clever-place-window win)
Places WIN just as if being placed by fvwm2's SmartPlacement,
as if SmartPlacementIsReallySmart were in effect. That is, it
tries to place the window so as to minimize its area of
overlap with other windows. Several parameters give different
weight to various kinds of windows, but they are not tunable
at runtime currently. If it fails to place the window, it
returns #f; otherwise it returns #t.
[From scwm/placement.c:478]

(default-decor)
Return the default decor.
[From scwm/decor.c:257]

This is the default placement procedure for non-transient
windows. It tries `smart-place-window',
`clever-place-window', `random-place-window', or
`interactive-move' (to achieve interactive placement) on WIN
depending on several settable style flags. However, if one of
the following factors holds, the window will instead be
placed exactly as requested by the program: the position was
specified by the user, the position was specified by the
program, and #:no-PPosition-hint is not set, or the window
starts iconic.
[From scwm/placement.c:556]


(default-transient-placement-proc win)
This is the default placement procedure for transient
windows. It simply leaves the window WIN in place, exactly as
requested.

window. WIN defaults to the window context in the usual way if not
specified.
[From scwm/window.c:1561]

application without giving it a chance to save its state or do any
other shutdown, but is guaranteed to work. WIN defaults to the window
context in the usual way if not specified.

(display-size)
Returns the size of the physical screen, in pixels, as a list of
the width and the height.

[From scwm/window.c:2404]


(get-window  #&amp;optional kill? select? release?)
Retrieve the context window or, if none is set, possible
select a window interactively. The optional boolean argument KILL?
(default #f) determines whether to use the "kill" cursor when
selecting interactively. The boolean SELECT? argument (default #t)
determines whether or not a window should be selected interactively if
there is no current context window. And finally the RELEASE? argument
(default #t) determines wether or not interactive selection (if any)
should wait for a mouse release event or just a press. The latter
behavior is useful if the action being performed on the window is an
interactive one involving mouse drags. (FIXMS: that's probably a bad
order for the optional arguments)
[From scwm/window.c:450]

Multiply the luminosity and saturation of COLOR by the
positive floating point number FACTOR. Using a FACTOR smaller than 1

[From scwm/window.c:1476]


(random-place-window win)
Places WIN just as if being placed by fvwm2's
RandomPlacement.  This placement is not truly random; it is
based on two state variables which are incremented for the x
and y coordinates, and which wrap around once a window would
be forced off the screen. The placement is fairly arbitrary,
but always succeeds, and so avoids user interaction. #t is
always returned.

(select-window  #&amp;optional kill? release?)
Select a window interactively, by using a special cursor and
letting the user click to select the window. The optional arguments
KILL? and RELEASE? indicate whether to use the "skull and crossbones"
kill cursor (reccomended for destructive operations like delete-window
and destroy-window), and whether to wait for a mouse release or act
immediately on the click. The former is a placeholder until we have
proper cursor support in scwm.

Send a synthetic press of mouse button BUTTON, with modifier
MODIFIER. The event is sent to window WIN if specified; otherwise the
window to be used defaults to the window context in the usual way. By
default, both a press and a release are sent. However, the boolean
parameters BUTTON-PRESS? and BUTTON-RELEASE? allow you to specify
which are sent individually. PROPAGATE? indicates wether the propagate
flag is set on the event; the default is #f. You shouldn't have to
worry about this unless you know what it means.
[From scwm/events.c:1734]


(send-key-press key #&amp;optional win key-press? key-release? propagate?)
Send a synthetic press of KEY. The usual key specification
format (with modifiers) is used. The event is sent to window WIN if
specified; otherwise the window to be used defaults to the window
context in the usual way. By default, both a press and a release are
sent. However, the boolean parameters KEY-PRESS? and KEY-RELEASE?
allow you to specify which are sent individually. PROPAGATE? indicates
wether the propagate flag is set on the event; the default is #f. You
shouldn't have to worry about this unless you know what it means.

(set-animation! vector)
Set the animation parameters to VECTOR. VECTOR is a vector of
floats which give the fractions of the final position that the window
should appear at. For intance, #(0.0 0.25 0.5 0.75 1.0 1.1 1.0) would
make the window appear at the initial positon, 1/4 of the way, 1/2 of
the way, 3/4 of the way, overshoot the finall position slightly, and
finally slide back into place. This parameter is used for both
animated window shades and animated moves.

In the current decor, use ACTIVE-UP as the face for the
button specified by the integer BUTTON when active and not pressed
in. Use ACTIVE-DOWN when BUTTON is active and pressed in, and INACTIVE
when the window is inactive. Both INACTIVE and ACTIVE-DOWN default to
ACTIVE-UP when not specified. Note that ACTIVE-DOWN will magically
reverse the sense of the relief flag, so if the button is raised in
the ACTIVE-UP state, it will be sunk in the ACTIVE-DOWN state by
default.
[From scwm/face.c:852]


(set-button-mwm-flag! button flag)
Specify the Mwm flag for BUTTON, that is, specify wether or
not it's relief pattern (if any) should reverse in depth sense when
the window is maximized. This is specified by the boolean value FLAG.
