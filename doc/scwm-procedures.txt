(add-input-hook! port proc)
Add an input hook to run PROC on input from PORT.
Whenever input becomes available on PORT, procedure PROC will be called
with no arguments repeatedly until no unprocessed input remains on
PORT. PORT must be open, it must be an input port, and it must be a
file port (this includes pipes and sockets, but not string ports or
soft ports). A handle suitable for passing to `remove-input-hook!' is
returned.

(clear-color-cache-entry name)
Colors are cached by name. It is remotely possible that the
meaning of a particular string as a color will change in your X
server, if you try hard enough. For this unlikely eventuality,
`clear-color-cache-entry' is provided - it removes the color
associated with NAME from the color cache.
[From scwm/color.c:178]


(clear-font-cache-entry name)
Fonts are cached by name. It is remotely possible that the
meaning of a particular string as a fonts will change in your X
server, if you try hard enough (perhaps if you add or remove font
servers). For this unlikely eventuality, `clear-font-cache-entry' is
provided - it removes the font associated with NAME from the font
cache.
[From scwm/font.c:387]


(clear-image-cache-entry name)
Images are cached by both name and full pathname. It is
remotely possible that the file that should be used for a particular
name will change, for example if you alter the image file or change
your image path. For this unlikely eventuality,
`clear-image-cache-entry' is provided - it removes the image
associated with NAME from the image cache.
[From scwm/image.c:544]


(clever-place-window win)
Places WIN using fvwm2's "ReallySmart" algorithm.
The placement is just as if being placed by fvwm2's SmartPlacement,
as if SmartPlacementIsReallySmart were in effect. That is, it
tries to place the window so as to minimize its area of
overlap with other windows. Several parameters give different
weight to various kinds of windows, but they are not tunable
at runtime currently. If it fails to place the window, it
returns #f; otherwise it returns #t.

(default-placement-proc win)
Use various flags to call an appropriate placement function.
This is the default placement procedure for non-transient windows. It
tries `smart-place-window', `clever-place-window',
`random-place-window', or `interactive-move' (to achieve interactive
placement) on WIN depending on several style flags. However,
if one of the following factors holds, the window will instead be
placed exactly as requested by the program: the position was specified
by the user, the position was specified by the program, and
#:no-PPosition-hint is not set, or the window starts iconic.
[From scwm/placement.c:510]


(default-transient-placement-proc win)
This is the default placement procedure for transient windows.
It simply leaves the window WIN in place, exactly as requested.
[From scwm/placement.c:563]

(get-window  #&optional kill? select? release?)
Retrieve the context window or select interactively.
If there is no context window, a window is selected interactively.
The optional boolean argument KILL?  (default #f) determines whether
to use the "kill" cursor when selecting interactively. The boolean
SELECT? argument (default #t) determines whether or not a window
should be selected interactively if there is no current context
window. And finally the RELEASE? argument (default #t) determines
whether or not interactive selection (if any) should wait for a mouse
release event or just a press. The latter behavior is useful if the
action being performed on the window is an interactive one involving
mouse drags. (FIXMS: that's probably a bad order for the optional
arguments)
[From scwm/window.c:643]

(select-window  #&optional kill? release?)
Select a window interactively.
Use a special cursor and let the user click to select the window. The
optional arguments KILL? and RELEASE? indicate whether to use the
"skull and cross-bones" kill cursor (recommended for destructive
operations like delete-window and destroy-window), and whether to wait
for a mouse release or act immediately on the click. The former is a
place-holder until we have proper cursor support in scwm.
[From scwm/window.c:576]


(select-window-interactively  #&optional msg)
Returns a window selected interactively while displaying MSG.
Returns #f if no window was selected. Display no message if MSG not given.

(send-button-press button #&optional win button-press? button-release? propagate?)
Send a synthetic mouse press event.
Create a synthetic event of a press of mouse button BUTTON. The usual
mouse button specification format (with modifiers) is used. Send the
event to window WIN if specified; otherwise the window to be used
defaults to the window context in the usual way. By default, both a
press and a release are sent. However, the boolean parameters
BUTTON-PRESS? and BUTTON-RELEASE? allow you to specify which are sent
individually. PROPAGATE? indicates whether the propagate flag is set
on the event; the default is #f. You should not have to worry about
this unless you know what it means.
[From scwm/events.c:1781]


(send-key-press key #&optional win key-press? key-release? propagate?)
Send a synthetic press of KEY. The usual key specification
format (with modifiers) is used. The event is sent to window WIN if
specified; otherwise the window to be used defaults to the window
context in the usual way. By default, both a press and a release are
sent. However, the boolean parameters KEY-PRESS? and KEY-RELEASE?
allow you to specify which are sent individually. PROPAGATE? indicates
whether the propagate flag is set on the event; the default is #f. You
should not have to worry about this unless you know what it means.
[From scwm/events.c:1716]


(set-animation! vector)
Set the animation parameters to VECTOR. VECTOR is a vector of
floats which give the fractions of the final position that the window
should appear at. For instance, #(0.0 0.25 0.5 0.75 1.0 1.1 1.0) would
make the window appear at the initial position, 1/4 of the way, 1/2 of
the way, 3/4 of the way, overshoot the final position slightly, and
finally slide back into place. This parameter is used for both
animated window shades and animated moves.

Set the button faces for the various window states.
In the current decor, use ACTIVE-UP as the face for the
button specified by the integer BUTTON when active and not pressed
in. Use ACTIVE-DOWN when BUTTON is active and pressed in, and INACTIVE
when the window is inactive. Both INACTIVE and ACTIVE-DOWN default to
ACTIVE-UP when not specified. Note that ACTIVE-DOWN will magically
reverse the sense of the relief flag, so if the button is raised in
the ACTIVE-UP state, it will be sunk in the ACTIVE-DOWN state by
default.
[From scwm/face.c:872]


(set-button-mwm-flag! button flag)
Specify the Mwm flag for BUTTON.
If FLAG is #t, the button's relief pattern (if any) will appear to

FTYPE can either be 'mouse, indicating that the window under the mouse
pointer should always have it's colormap installed, or 'focus to
indicate that the window with the input focus should also get the
colormap focus. This makes a difference only when using focus policies
other than 'mouse.

particular fields in the window structure. Also, a
window-property-change-hook mechanism will soon be implemented for
notification of all window property changes. This is not yet done. The
window property primitives should be considered in flux.

(window-deletable?  #&optional win)
Return #t if WIN is able to be deleted, #f otherwise.
Scwm may call `delete-window' on WIN only if this procedure returns
#t. WIN defaults to the window context in the usual way if not
specified.

(window-desk  #&optional win)
Return the desk that WIN is currently on. WIN defaults to the
window context in the usual way if not specified.
[From scwm/window.c:2350]


(window-frame-id  #&optional win)
Return the X window id for the outermost frame window of WIN.
WIN defaults to the window context in the usual way if not
specified.
[From scwm/window.c:2293]


(window-icon win)
Get the icon image being used for WIN.
Returns #f if none is being used. WIN defaults to the window context
in the usual way if not specified.
[From scwm/window.c:3087]


(window-icon-title  #&optional win)
Return the icon window title of WIN.
This is the title as requested by the application . WIN defaults to
the window context in the usual way if not specified.
[From scwm/window.c:2373]


(window-id  #&optional win)
Return the X window id for WIN.

in the usual way if not specified.
[From scwm/window.c:3139]


(window-position  #&optional win)
Return the position of WIN in pixels.
The position is returned as a list of the x coordinate and the y
coordinate in pixels. WIN defaults to the window context in the usual
way if not specified.
[From scwm/window.c:2221]


(window-property win prop)
Retrieve window property PROP of WIN.
PROP should be a symbol. #f will be returned if the property does not
exist (wether set by `set-window-property!' or otherwise). Soon, some
properties will have magical meanings, accessing particular fields in
the window structure. Also, a window-property-change-hook mechanism
will soon be implemented for notification of all window property
changes. This is not yet done. The window property primitives should
be considered in flux.
[From scwm/window.c:3339]


(window-resource  #&optional win)
Return the window resource instance of WIN. WIN defaults to
the window context in the usual way if not specified.
[From scwm/window.c:2398]


(window-shade  #&optional win animated?)
Cause WIN to become "window-shaded".
That is, to roll up into just a titlebar. By default, the change takes
place instantaneously. However, if the optional ANIMATED? argument is
true, the window will be animated as it rolls up, producing a pleasing
visual effect. WIN defaults to the window context in the usual way if
not specified.
[From scwm/window.c:1833]


(window-shaded?  #&optional win)
Return #t if WIN is shaded.
WIN defaults to the window context in the usual way if not
specified.
[From scwm/window.c:1948]


(window-size  #&optional win)
Return the size of WIN. The position is returned as a list of
the width and the height in pixels. WIN defaults to the window context
in the usual way if not specified.
[From scwm/window.c:2261]


(window-title  #&optional win)
Return the window title of WIN, as requested by the application.
WIN defaults to the window context in the usual way if not specified.
[From scwm/window.c:2362]


(window-transient-for  #&optional win)
Return the window for which WIN is transient.
If WIN is transient, and the window it is transient for is
not the root window and is being managed by scwm, this returns the window
object of the window that WIN is transient for, otherwise return
#f. WIN defaults to the window context in the usual way if not
specified.
[From scwm/window.c:1679]


(window-xproperty win name #&optional consume)
Get and maybe delete the property called NAME from WIN.
The property will be deleted upon getting (in an atomic operation)
if the boolean value CONSUME is #t
[From scwm/xproperty.c:179]


(window? obj)
Returns #t if OBJ is a window object, otherwise returns #f.
[From scwm/window.c:567]


(X-display-information)
Return some information about the screen. In particular,
return a list of the horizontal resolution, the vertical resolution,
the number of planes on the current screen (i.e. the bit depth), the
bits per color supported by the hardware, the visual class (one of
"StaticGray", "GrayScale", "StaticColor", "PseudoColor", "DirectColor"
or "TrueColor") and a boolean indicating whether the display is color.
The resolutions mentioned above should in theory be pixels per
centimeter, rounded to the nearest integer. These parameters can be
used for various workarounds or conditional decisions in a scwmrc to
be shared among multiple machines.
[From scwm/miscprocs.c:528]


(X-pointer-mapping)
Return the mapping of physical->logical pointer buttons as a list.
The length of the returned list is the number of buttons available.  Each
element in the list is an integer.  E.g., '(1 2 3) is a normally mapped
3-button mouse, whereas '(3 2 1) is a 3-button mouse where the rightmost
physical button acts as logical button 1, and the leftmost acts as button 3.
[From scwm/binding.c:872]


(X-version-information)
Return some information about the version of the running X server.
