- (app scwm placement)
Return a procedure that places a window at the pointer position.
If the keyword argument OFFSET is specified, it is interpreted as a
list of x and y offsets to add to the pointer position. If the keyword
argument PROPORTIONAL-OFFSET is specified, it is interpreted as a list
of numbers to multiply by the window's width and height, and is
treated as an extra offset.The defaults are (0 0) for OFFSET and (-0.5
-0.5) for PROPORTIONAL-OFFSET, with the result that by default the
window is centered at the mouse pointer position by the returned
procedure.

If SWITCH is true, the returned procedure will switch to the virtual
desk and viewport of its window argument before placing it. This is
the default. If RETURN is false, the returned procedure will switch
back to the previous desk and viewport after placing the window. The
default is false.

a window at the pointer position.

MAX-SIZE, by default the display size.

RESIZE may be #f, 'shrink-only or 'always, indicating that the windows

only if they are bigger, or that they should always be resized to the
max size. The default is 'shrink-only.

RAISE may be #f, #t, or 'restack-only, indicating that the windows
should not be moved in the stacking order; that they should be raised
on top of other windows and placed in the cascade order with the upper
left window lowest in the stacking order; or that they should be
restacked as for #t but not raised above other windows,
respectively. The default is 'restack-only.

X-INCREMENT may be an integer or a procedure that takes a window and
returns an integer, and which will be applied to a window to get the
horizontal offset for the next in the cascade order. The default is
the sum of the window's border width and title height.

Y-INCREMENT may be an integer or a procedure that takes a window and

(clever-place-window win)
- Built-in Primitive
Places WIN using fvwm2's "ReallySmart" algorithm.
The placement is just as if being placed by fvwm2's SmartPlacement,
as if SmartPlacementIsReallySmart were in effect. That is, it
tries to place the window so as to minimize its area of
overlap with other windows. Several parameters give different
weight to various kinds of windows, but they are not tunable
at runtime currently. If it fails to place the window, it
returns #f; otherwise it returns #t.
This is called as part of `default-placement-proc'.  It could also be
used in user-defined placement procedures (see
`set-window-placement-proc!').

These arguments are useful since `move-window' and `move-to' will
refer to the icon window (not the frame window) if a window is iconified.
Without being able to specify a position on de-iconification, the window
cannot, e.g., cleanly be brought back onto the current viewport.

Popup a window list menu and permit a selection to be made.
ONLY and EXCEPT are procedures that control which windows will appear
in the list -- see `list-windows' for details. BY-STACKING, BY-FOCUS
and REVERSE control the order in which windows appear. See
`list-windows' for more on these as well.

PROC is the procedure which will be called on the selected window. 

FLASH-WINDOW-PROC and UNFLASH-WINDOW-PROC are set as the hover-action
and unhover-action (respectively) of the items in the menu.  (See
`menuitem'.)

If SHOW-GEOMETRY is #t, the geometries of the windows will be listed
in each menuitem.  

If SHOW-LAST-FOCUS-TIME is #t, the last focus time of the windows will be listed
in each menuitem.

If SHOW-MINI-ICON is #t, the mini-icon of the windows will be
displayed with each menuitem.

If WARP-TO-FIRST is #t, the mouse pointer will be warped to the first
menuitem (see `popup-menu').  

If BY-RESOURCE is #t, the window list is split into sublists by the
window resource name (this is also the behaviour if too many windows
exist to fit vertically on the menu).

If ENUMERATE-HOT-KEYS is #t, then add alpha-numeric hot keys for the window-list.
For the hotkey, the characters 1 through 9 are used first, followed by
the letters a through z.  Currently this is turned off if BY-RESOURCE is #t.

(message-window-options action #&key enable
					follow-window 
					position gravity offset

- (app scwm message-window)
Allow specification of message-window behavior for standard actions.

ACTION specifies the action for which this behavior should be
used. Currently, 'interactive-move and 'interactive-resize are the
only useful values. 

ENABLE is a boolean value inidicating whether to use a message window
for that action at all.

GRAVITY indicates which point on the message window is used as the
control point for placing it. See `gravity->alignmnents' for a list of
valid gravity specs.

If FOLLOW-WINDOW is true, the message window will track the window on
which an action is being performed, if applicable. In this case,
POSITION is ignored; OFFSET is taken as a list of the X and Y offsets
from the window's top left corner, and PROPORTIONAL-OFFSET is taken as
a list of factors to multiply by the window's size. For instance, an
OFFSET of (0 0) and a PROPORTIONAL-OFFSET of (0.5 0.5) will place the
message window at the center of of the window being operated on.

However, if FOLLOW-WINDOW is false, or there is no applicable window,

Places WIN just as if being placed by fvwm2's RandomPlacement.
This placement is not truly random; it is based on two state variables
which are incremented for the x and y coordinates, and which wrap
around once a window would be forced off the screen. The placement is
fairly arbitrary, but always succeeds, and so avoids user
interaction. #t is always returned.
This is called as part of `default-placement-proc'.  It could also be
used in user-defined placement procedures (see
`set-window-placement-proc!').

(set-window-property! win prop val)
- Built-in Primitive
Set window property PROP of WIN to VAL.
PROP should be a symbol. VAL may be any Scheme object. This name/value
pair will be associated with the window, and may be retrieved with

instead. Soon, some properties will have magical meanings, altering
particular fields in the window structure. Also, a
window-property-change-hook mechanism will soon be implemented for
notification of all window property changes. This is not yet done. The
window property primitives should be considered in flux.

Tile the windows on the specified desk.
The DESK option, defaulting to the current desk, specifies which desk;
ALL-VIEWPORTS, when true indicates that the windows in all viewports
of this desk should be tiled, otherwise only the current viewport
is tiled. 

The options ONLY, EXCEPT, BY-STACKING, BY-FOCUS and REVERSE indicate
the windows to use and the order to use them in, as with
`list-windows'. However, unless IGNORE-DEFAULT-EXCEPTIONS is #t,
transient, maximized, sticky and iconified windows will be always be

- (app scwm tile)
Tile WINDOWS according to several parameters.  

Tiling places the windows according to a grid from START-POS, (0 0) by
default, to END-POS, the size of the display by default. 

If MAX-WINDOWS is specified and not #f, at most MAX-WINDOWS elements
of WINDOWS will be operated on.

If ORDER is 'horizontal, the windows will be tiled in row-major order;
if it is 'vertical they will be tiled in column-major oder.

RESIZE may be #f, 'shrink-only or 'always, indicating that the windows
should never be resized, that they should be resized to the max-size
only if they are bigger, or that they should always be resized to the
max size. The default is 'shrink-only.

RAISE may be #f, #t, or 'restack-only, indicating that the windows
should not be moved in the stacking order; that they should be raised
on top of other windows and placed in the tile order with the upper
left window lowest in the stacking order; or that they should be
restacked as for #t but not raised above other windows,

Return a predicate that tests a window's title.  
When applied to a window, this predicate will return true if the title
matches STRING in the manner specified by the optional argument TYPE,
which may be 'exact, 'regexp, or 'wildcard. The optional
CASE-SENSITIVE argument determines whether the matching is

Set the title style in the current decor.
FONT is the window title font, a font object or a string.
HEIGHT is the height of the title bar, in points.
JUSTIFY is one of 'left, 'right, or 'center.
This function also takes the keyword arguments #:relief, #:solid,
#:gradient, #:h-gradient, #:v-gradient, and #:pixmap, with effects
as described under the `Face Flags' and `Face Specification Flags'
concepts (except that #:pixmap is always tiled, and #:h-gradient
and #:v-gradient are horizontal and vertical gradients).  These
extra keyword arguments can either be included in the main argument
list, or lists of these arguments can be used as the ACTIVE-UP,
ACTIVE-DOWN, or INACTIVE arguments.  For instance:
  (title-style #:solid "red" #:inactive (list #:solid "green"))
would set the title to be red in either active state, and green
in the inactive state, leaving FONT, HEIGHT, and JUSTIFY in their
current state, and returning everything else about the title
to their default state.

(uri-escapify-comma uri)
- (app scwm netscape)
Replace commas in URI with the %2C escape code.
