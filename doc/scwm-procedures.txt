(clever-place-window win)
- Built-in Primitive
Places WIN using fvwm2's "ReallySmart" algorithm.
The placement is just as if being placed by fvwm2's SmartPlacement,
as if SmartPlacementIsReallySmart were in effect. That is, it
tries to place the window so as to minimize its area of
overlap with other windows. Several parameters give different
weight to various kinds of windows, but they are not tunable
at runtime currently. If it fails to place the window, it
returns #f; otherwise it returns #t.

(default-placement-proc win)

Use various flags to call an appropriate placement function.
This is the default placement procedure for non-transient windows. It
tries `smart-place-window', `clever-place-window',
`random-place-window', or `interactive-move' (to achieve interactive
placement) on WIN depending on several style flags. However,
if one of the following factors holds, the window will instead be
placed exactly as requested by the program: the position was specified
by the user, the position was specified by the program, and
#:no-PPosition-hint is not set, or the window starts iconic.

(get-window  #&optional kill? select? release?)
- Built-in Primitive
Retrieve the context window or select interactively.
If there is no context window, a window is selected interactively.

should be selected interactively if there is no current context
window. And finally the RELEASE? argument (default #t) determines
whether or not interactive selection (if any) should wait for a mouse
release event or just a press. The latter behavior is useful if the
action being performed on the window is an interactive one involving
mouse drags. (FIXMS: that's probably a bad order for the optional

the way, 3/4 of the way, overshoot the final position slightly, and
finally slide back into place. This parameter is used for both
animated window shades and animated moves.

Set window property PROP of WIN to VAL.
PROP should be a symbol. VAL may be any Scheme object. This name/value

instead. Soon, some properties will have magical meanings, altering
particular fields in the window structure. Also, a
window-property-change-hook mechanism will soon be implemented for
notification of all window property changes. This is not yet done. The
window property primitives should be considered in flux.
