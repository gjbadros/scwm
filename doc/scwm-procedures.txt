this is a version of map that allows the mapping function to return
any number of elements to be inserted into the result list, including
possibly none.

Cascade WINDOWS according to several parameters.  
Cascading places the windows in a diagonal order starting at
START-POS, (0 0) by default. Each window's size is limited to
MAX-SIZE, by default the display size.

RESIZE may be #f, 'shrink-only or 'always, indicating that the windows
should never be resized, that they should be resized to the max-size
only if they are bigger, or that they should always be resized to the
max size. The default is 'shrink-only.

RAISE may be #f, #t, or 'restack-only, indicating that the windows
should not be moved in the stacking order; that they should be raised
on top of other windows and placed in the cascade order with the upper
left window lowest in the stacking order; or that they should be
restacked as for #t but not raised above other windows,
respectively. The default is #t.

X-INCREMENT may be an integer or a procedure that takes a window and
returns an integer, and which will be applied to a window to get the
horizontal offset for the next in the cascade order. The default is
the sum of the window's border width and title height.

Y-INCREMENT may be an integer or a procedure that takes a window and
returns an integer, and which will be applied to a window to get the
vertical offset for the next in the cascade order. The default is the
sum of the window's border width and title height.

(set-animation! vector)
- Built-in Primitive
Set the animation parameters to VECTOR. VECTOR is a vector of
floats which give the fractions of the final position that the window
should appear at. For instance, #(0.0 0.25 0.5 0.75 1.0 1.1 1.0) would
make the window appear at the initial position, 1/4 of the way, 1/2 of
the way, 3/4 of the way, overshoot the final position slightly, and
finally slide back into place. This parameter is used for both
animated window shades and animated moves.

object of the window that WIN is transient for, otherwise return
#f. WIN defaults to the window context in the usual way if not
specified.
[From scwm/window.c:1894]


(window-unshade  #&optional win)
- Built-in Primitive
Reverse the effect of `window-shade' on WIN.
The change takes place instantaneously. WIN defaults to the window
context in the usual way if not specified.
[From scwm/window.c:2106]


(window-viewport-position #&optional (win (get-window)))
- (app scwm base)
Return the position of WIN in pixels within the viewport.
The position is returned as a list of the x coordinate and the y
coordinate in pixels. WIN defaults to the window context in the usual
way if not specified.  See also `window-position'.
[From scheme/base.scm:197]


(window-virtual-position #&optional (win (get-window)))
- (app scwm base)
Return the virtual position of WIN in pixels.
If WIN is sticky, this returns the position of the window in the
current viewport.
[From scheme/base.scm:206]


(window? obj)
- Built-in Primitive
Returns #t if OBJ is a window object, otherwise returns #f.
[From scwm/window.c:722]


(windows-overlap? win win2)
- (app scwm wininfo)
Return #t if WIN and WIN2 overlap at all, else #f.
I.e., returns #t if the intersection of the windows' areas
is non-empty.
[From scheme/wininfo.scm:75]


(winlist-hit #&optional (win (get-window)))
- (app scwm winlist)
Permit WIN to be displayed in the window list by default.
This resets the 'winlist-skip property of WIN.  See also `winlist-skip'.
[From scheme/winlist.scm:77]


(winlist-skip #&optional (win (get-window)))
- (app scwm winlist)
Do not show WIN in the window list by default.
This sets the 'winlist-skip property of WIN.  See also `winlist-hit'.
[From scheme/winlist.scm:82]


(winlist-skip? #&optional (win (get-window)))
- (app scwm winlist)
Return #t of WIN is skipped in the window list, #f otherwise.
[From scheme/winlist.scm:87]


(write-all port . lst)
- (app scwm flux)
Write all arguments into the port. #t means `current-output-port'.
[From scheme/flux.scm:74]


(x- x)
- (app scwm base)
Return the viewport pixel coordinate X pixels left of the right display edge.
[From scheme/base.scm:60]


(X-atom->string atom)
- Built-in Primitive
Returns the string represented by ATOM.
Returns #f, if the X atom was not known.
[From scwm/xproperty.c:343]


(X-atomic-property-set-if-unset! window name value #&optional
						(type "STRING") (format 8))
- (app scwm flux)
Set property NAME on WINDOW to VALUE, if it's currently unset.
Returns #f if the property is already set, #t otherwise.
TYPE and FORMAT are as in X-property-set!
[From scheme/flux.scm:604]


(X-cut-buffer-string)
- (app scwm flux)
Return the text of the CUT_BUFFER0 property of the root window.
This is the cut text selected by X clients.  Returns #f if the
CUT_BUFFER0 property is not a string.
[From scheme/flux.scm:545]


(X-display-information)
- Built-in Primitive
Return some information about the screen. In particular,
return a list of the horizontal resolution, the vertical resolution,
the number of planes on the current screen (i.e. the bit depth), the
bits per color supported by the hardware, the visual class (one of
"StaticGray", "GrayScale", "StaticColor", "PseudoColor", "DirectColor"
or "TrueColor") and a boolean indicating whether the display is color.
The resolutions mentioned above should in theory be pixels per
centimeter, rounded to the nearest integer. These parameters can be
used for various workarounds or conditional decisions in a scwmrc to
be shared among multiple machines.
[From scwm/miscprocs.c:570]


(X-grab-server)
- Built-in Primitive
Grab the X server.
This is very risky; you should almost definitely use
`with-grabbed-server' instead.  This must be paired with
X-ungrab-server.  This primitive is undefined at startup
to make it hard to access directly.
[From scwm/Grab.c:56]


(X-pointer-mapping)
- Built-in Primitive
Return the mapping of physical->logical pointer buttons as a list.
The length of the returned list is the number of buttons available.  Each
element in the list is an integer.  E.g., '(1 2 3) is a normally mapped
3-button mouse, whereas '(3 2 1) is a 3-button mouse where the rightmost
physical button acts as logical button 1, and the leftmost acts as button 3.
[From scwm/binding.c:869]


(X-property-get win name #&optional consume)
- Built-in Primitive
Get X property NAME of window WIN.
WIN is the window to check, or 'root-window.
NAME is a string.
If CONSUME is #t, the X property is deleted after getting it. Default is
not to delete.
If the X property could not be found, #f is returned.
If the X property could be found, a list "(value type format)" is returned.
"type" is a string.
"format" is either 8, 16, or 32, giving the size of the elements of "value".
"value" is a string, if "format" is 8, or a vector of integers otherwise.
[From scwm/xproperty.c:232]


(X-property-set! win name value #&optional type format action)
- Built-in Primitive
Set X property NAME on window WIN to VALUE.
WIN is the window to set the X property on, or 'root-window.
NAME and TYPE are strings. TYPE defaults to "STRING".
FORMAT may be one of the integers 8, 16, and 32, defining the element size
of the VALUE. It is 8 by default.
VALUE may be a string, if FORMAT is 8, and may always be a vector
of FORMAT-bit integers.
ACTION - one of the symbols 'replace, 'prepend, or 'append signifying
how the new VALUE should be merged (if at all) with the existing
value.
[From scwm/xproperty.c:103]


(X-resource-database-save filename)
- Built-in Primitive
Save the Scwm resource database to FILENAME.
Only the settings set or changed via `X-resource-put' go into
the file.
[From scwm/xrm.c:85]


(X-resource-get name #&optional xclass)
- Built-in Primitive
Get X resource specified by NAME and XCLASS from Xrm database.
Both NAME and XCLASS are strings, as is the returned value.  If
XCLASS is omitted, it defaults to the same string as NAME.
If there is no resource under the given key, #f is returned.
[From scwm/xrm.c:52]


(X-resource-put resource value)
- Built-in Primitive
Stores string VALUE as X resource RESOURCE (also a string).
Later, the value can be retrieved using `X-resource-get'.
[From scwm/xrm.c:27]


(X-rotate-cut-buffers n)
- Built-in Primitive
Rotate the X cut buffers by N positions.
This means buffer 0 becomes buffer n, buffer 1 becomes n + 1 mod 8,
and so on.  This cut buffer numbering is global to the display.
[From scwm/miscprocs.c:445]


(X-synthetic-send-string str #&optional (win (get-window)))
- (app scwm flux)
Send string STR to WIN via synthetic X events.
Note that some programs (e.g., xterm) by default do not
honour synthetic key events as they are a security hole.
[From scheme/flux.scm:319]


(X-ungrab-server)
- Built-in Primitive
Ungrab the X server.
Using these functions directly is risky; you should almost definitely use
`with-grabbed-server' instead. This primitive is undefined at startup
to make it hard to access directly.
[From scwm/Grab.c:70]


(X-version-information)
- Built-in Primitive
Return some information about the version of the running X server.
Return value is a list of the X protocol version, the X protocol
revision, the X server vendor, and the vendor release number.
