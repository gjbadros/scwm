(add-input-hook! port proc)
Add an input hook to run PROC on input from PORT.
Whenever input becomes available on PORT, procedure PROC will be called
with no arguments repeatedly until no unprocessed input remains on
PORT. PORT must be open, it must be an input port, and it must be a
file port (this includes pipes and sockets, but not string ports or
soft ports). A handle suitable for passing to `remove-input-hook!' is
returned.
[From scwm/callbacks.c:559]


(add-timer-hook! usec proc)
Add a timer hook to call PROC once sometime after USEC microseconds.
When at least USEC microseconds have passed, procedure PROC will be
called with no arguments. A handle suitable for passing to
`remove-timer-hook!' is returned.

WIN defaults to the window context in the usual way if not
specified.
[From scwm/window.c:2608]


(capturing?)

This happens at two times: both during initial startup, or during a
recapture operation. In either case, placement procedures should
probably avoid interaction and perhaps avoid moving the window being
placed at all.
[From scwm/miscprocs.c:132]


(clear-color-cache-entry name)
Colors are cached by name. It is remotely possible that the
meaning of a particular string as a color will change in your X
server, if you try hard enough. For this unlikely eventuality,

servers). For this unlikely eventuality, `clear-font-cache-entry' is
provided - it removes the font associated with NAME from the font
cache.
[From scwm/font.c:353]


(clear-image-cache-entry name)
Images are cached by both name and full pathname. It is
remotely possible that the file that should be used for a particular
name will change, for example if you alter the image file or change
your image path. For this unlikely eventuality,
`clear-image-cache-entry' is provided - it removes the image
associated with NAME from the image cache.

(clever-place-window win)
Places WIN using fvwm2's "ReallySmart" algorithm.
The placement is just as if being placed by fvwm2's SmartPlacement,
as if SmartPlacementIsReallySmart were in effect. That is, it
tries to place the window so as to minimize its area of
overlap with other windows. Several parameters give different
weight to various kinds of windows, but they are not tunable
at runtime currently. If it fails to place the window, it
returns #f; otherwise it returns #t.
[From scwm/placement.c:468]

(default-placement-proc win)
Use various flags to call an appropriate placement function.
This is the default placement procedure for non-transient windows. It
tries `smart-place-window', `clever-place-window',
`random-place-window', or `interactive-move' (to achieve interactive
placement) on WIN depending on several style flags. However,
if one of the following factors holds, the window will instead be
placed exactly as requested by the program: the position was specified
by the user, the position was specified by the program, and
#:no-PPosition-hint is not set, or the window starts iconic.
[From scwm/placement.c:541]


(default-transient-placement-proc win)

application without giving it a chance to save its state or do any
other shutdown, but is guaranteed to work. WIN defaults to the window
context in the usual way if not specified.
[From scwm/window.c:1382]


(display-size)
Returns the size of the physical screen in pixels.
The return value is list of the width and the height. The
width is the `car', the height is the `cadr' of the returned list.

(get-window  #&optional kill? select? release?)
Retrieve the context window or select interactively.
If there is no context window, a window is selected interactively.
The optional boolean argument KILL?  (default #f) determines whether
to use the "kill" cursor when selecting interactively. The boolean
SELECT? argument (default #t) determines whether or not a window
should be selected interactively if there is no current context
window. And finally the RELEASE? argument (default #t) determines
whether or not interactive selection (if any) should wait for a mouse
release event or just a press. The latter behavior is useful if the
action being performed on the window is an interactive one involving
mouse drags. (FIXMS: that's probably a bad order for the optional
arguments)
[From scwm/window.c:606]


(hide-titlebar  #&optional win)

Move WIN interactively.
This allows the user to drag a rubber band frame or the window itself
around the screen (depending on the setting of `set-opaque-move-size!'
and drop it where desired). WIN defaults to the window context in the
usual way if not specified.  If OPAQUE? is #t, the move will be done
"opaquely", moving the actual X window, if #f a rubberband will be
used instead to save on server computation (note that the rubberband
requires a server "grab" which means that nothing else changes on
screen while the non-opaque move takes place.

(interactive-resize  #&optional win opaque?)
Resize WIN interactively.
This allows the user to drag a rubber band frame to set the size of

In the current decor, use ACTIVE-UP as the face for the
button specified by the integer BUTTON when active and not pressed
in. Use ACTIVE-DOWN when BUTTON is active and pressed in, and INACTIVE
when the window is inactive. Both INACTIVE and ACTIVE-DOWN default to
ACTIVE-UP when not specified. Note that ACTIVE-DOWN will magically
reverse the sense of the relief flag, so if the button is raised in
the ACTIVE-UP state, it will be sunk in the ACTIVE-DOWN state by
default.
[From scwm/face.c:863]


(set-button-mwm-flag! button flag)
Specify the Mwm flag for BUTTON.
If FLAG is #t, the button's relief pattern (if any) will appear to
reverse in depth sense (i.e., flip from sunken in to extruding out)
when the window is maximized.

offered when scrolling things past the edge, in two different
senses. SR is an amount in microseconds that indicates how long the
mouse pointer must stay at the edge of the screen before the viewport
scrolls. If this parameter is greater than 10,000, the viewport will
not scroll at all at the screen edge (FIXMS: that's a bogus way to
indicate that.) MR is an amount in pixels that indicates how many
pixels past the edge of the screen a window must be moved before it
will really go past the edge.
[From scwm/deskpage.c:152]


(set-edge-scroll! sx sy)
Set the edge scroll amount in pixels.
The edge scroll setting is the amount by which the viewport will scroll

physical button acts as logical button 1, and the leftmost acts as button 3.
