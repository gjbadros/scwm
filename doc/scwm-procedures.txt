Add an input hook to run PROC on input from PORT.

This is the default placement procedure for non-transient windows. It

placement) on WIN depending on several style flags. However,
if one of the following factors holds, the window will instead be
placed exactly as requested by the program: the position was specified
by the user, the position was specified by the program, and

SELECT? argument (default #t) determines whether or not a window
should be selected interactively if there is no current context

whether or not interactive selection (if any) should wait for a mouse
release event or just a press. The latter behavior is useful if the
