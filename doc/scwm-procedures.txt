tries to place the window so as to minimize its area of
overlap with other windows. Several parameters give different
weight to various kinds of windows, but they are not tunable
at runtime currently. If it fails to place the window, it
returns #f; otherwise it returns #t.

placement) on WIN depending on several style flags. However,
if one of the following factors holds, the window will instead be
placed exactly as requested by the program: the position was specified
by the user, the position was specified by the program, and

button specified by the integer BUTTON when active and not pressed
in. Use ACTIVE-DOWN when BUTTON is active and pressed in, and INACTIVE
when the window is inactive. Both INACTIVE and ACTIVE-DOWN default to
