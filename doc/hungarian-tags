Greg's list of Hungarian notation tags used in scwm


Standard tags
-------------
sz  = a null-terminated ("C") string
ch  = a character
f   = a boolean flag


Standard prefixes
-----------------
c   = a count
p   = a pointer
i   = an index
rg  = a ReGion (an array)
d   = a difference


Scwm tags
---------
scm   = a scheme object
menu  = a Menu object (the wrapped object, not the wrapping scheme object)
mi    = a MenuItem object (")
md    = a DynamicMenu object (a given instance of a menu object)
mdi   = a MenuDrawingInfo object
miim  = a MenuItemInMenu object
cpix  = a bogus tag for count of pixels -- not really good Hungarian

"scm", especially is implied;  unfortunately, there are even places in 
the code where "menu" is an scmMenu, not a Menu object

Much code does not abide by these rules, beware -- it is a useful
program understanding tool, but regrettably cannot be relied upon
because of the legacy code.


Examples
--------

pch is a "char *", as is an sz;
  pch you might use to iterate through an array of chars (rgch),
  while using an sz for the same purpose is inappropriate

pmenu is a "Menu *"

rgpmiim is a "MenuItemInMenu *rgpmiim[]" or "MenuItemInMenu **rgpmiim"
  -- it is an array of pointers to MenuItemInMenu-s

ipmiim is an index into such an array


NOTE: A full variable name is prefixes + tag + qualifier -- when there
is only a single object of a given kind around, the qualifier is often
dropped. e.g., when iterating rgpmiim, I might use ipmiim, but
DynamicMenu objects have a ipmiimSelected which tells which
MenuItemInMenu object is currently selected (if any).
