Garbage collection
 - be sure to mark all contained scm objects

Dieing in malloc()?
 - free-d an already freed pointer; consider setting
   the pointer to NULL immediately after freeing it

Be sure not to use, e.g., menu_p() as a C boolean -- use MENU_P() instead
  - the object_p() functions return SCM_BOOL_F or SCM_BOOL_T both of which
    are evaluate as true in a C expression
