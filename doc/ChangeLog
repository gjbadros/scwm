	* scwm.1: Man page generated by Dale Smith
 	<dale.smith@bellhow.com> from available documentation. Extended to
 	also cover scwmexec and scwmrepl, and to point to the info page
 	more prominently; and also to mention the fvwm copyright.

	scwmexec.1, scwmrepl.1: just source scwm.1

	Makefile.am: install scwm.1, scwmexec.1 and scwmrepl.1

	Makefile.in: regenerated

	* scwm.texi, texinfo.tex, scwm.info: Info and texinfo
	documentation. For now, contains only a texinfoization of the
	procedure documentation, contributed by Dale Smith
	<dale.smith@bellhow.com>. It is out of date, incomplete, and in
	some cases plain false, but it is a start; hopefully people can
	extend this.

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in: new files; build and install scwm.info.
