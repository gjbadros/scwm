	* scwm.texi, texinfo.tex, scwm.info: Info and texinfo
	documentation. For now, contains only a texinfoization of the
	procedure documentation, contributed by Dale Smith
	<dale.smith@bellhow.com>. It is out of date, incomplete, and in
	some cases plain false, but it is a start; hopefully people can
	extend this.

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in: new files; build and install scwm.info.
