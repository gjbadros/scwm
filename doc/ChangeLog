1998-07-25  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am (scwm.sgml scwm-procedures.txt): Build
	  scwm-procedures.txt, scwm.sgml by default

1998-07-23  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.sgml: added links between functions, to the files (these
	are broken for other sites), and reduce redundancy in chapter 2 by 
	making it a bunch of itemizedlists with links to the alphabetical listing

	* Makefile.am (pkgdata_DATA): added scwm-procedures.txt so it gets 
	installed in $prefix/share/scwm

1998-07-22  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm-procedures.txt: Added -- renamed from primitives.txt, and
 	added the filename, line of definition, use ^L's to separate, and
	remove leading and trailing whitespace.  Generated by extract-docs 
	and the source code.

	* scwm.1: Man page generated by Dale Smith
 	<dale.smith@bellhow.com> from available documentation. Extended to
 	also cover scwmexec and scwmrepl, and to point to the info page
 	more prominently; and also to mention the fvwm copyright.

	scwmexec.1, scwmrepl.1: just source scwm.1

	Makefile.am: install scwm.1, scwmexec.1 and scwmrepl.1

	Makefile.in: regenerated
	
1998-06-20  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny5-15.ix.netcom.com>

	* scwm.texi, texinfo.tex, scwm.info: Info and texinfo
	documentation. For now, contains only a texinfoization of the
	procedure documentation, contributed by Dale Smith
	<dale.smith@bellhow.com>. It is out of date, incomplete, and in
	some cases plain false, but it is a start; hopefully people can
	extend this.

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in: new files; build and install scwm.info.
