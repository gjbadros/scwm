<para>This chapter discusses some high level concepts in Scwm.</para>

      </sect1>
    <sect1 id="Colors"><title>Colors</title><para>

  Colors are first-class objects. However, anywhere that a color is
taken as an argument, a string containing an X color specification
will also be accepted, and will be automatically converted to the
proper color object. Using the same color specifier string more than
once is not inefficient, as caching ensures that color objects are
shared.

    </para></sect1>
    <sect1 id="Creating-themes"><title>Creating themes</title><para>
Currently, the best documentation on themes is the source code;
however, here are a few notes.
To create a theme, create a new subdirectory of a directory in
`*theme-path*' (you'll probably want to add a private directory to 
`*theme-path*').  This subdirectory should be named the same as the
theme.  This subdirectory must contain (at least) a file named
theme.scm.  This file must create a module named
(app scwm theme your-theme-name), and define (in this module)
a theme object named <link linkend="the-theme"><function>the-theme</function></link>.  See the existing themes for
examples of what you can do when building <link linkend="the-theme"><function>the-theme</function></link>.

    </para></sect1>
    <sect1 id="Decors"><title>Decors</title><para>


  Decors are a means of managing the abundance of visual appearance
options for windows. In the original Fvwm code, there were many
options that could only be set globally, although they affected window
appearance. Decors are a compromise between leaving them global and
making them fully settable per window. These quasi-global options may
be set in a particular decor, and a decor may be attached to one or
more windows.

  Having to use decors to change certain aspects of the look and feel
is confusing. Scwm will probably move to some way of making these
options directly settable per-window at some point, especially if we
can figure out a way to not increase the memory overhead much.

    </para></sect1>
    <sect1 id="Desks"><title>Desks</title><para>


  Multiple virtual desktops are supported. A virtual desktop may be
bigger than the physical screen, in which case the current viewport on
the desktop may be moved around, as described in the Viewports entry.
Desks are identified by integers. There is currently an arbitrary
limit on the number of desks, but it should be much higher than anyone
will ever need. You can change the current desk with
<link linkend="set-current-desk-x"><function>set-current-desk!</function></link>; find out what the current desk is with
<link linkend="current-desk"><function>current-desk</function></link>; and set the desk a window is on with
<link linkend="set-window-desk-x"><function>set-window-desk!</function></link>.

    </para></sect1>
    <sect1 id="Event-Contexts"><title>Event Contexts</title><para>


There are various event contexts that are used as arguments
to the binding procedures.  Among these are:

  'window
  'title
  'icon
  'root
  'frame-corners
  'frame-sides
  'client-window
  'root-window
  'left-button-N  (N=1-5)
  'right-button-N (N=1-5)

GJB:FIXME:: This should be a definition list or a table, and give real
explanations of what these contexts mean!
 
    </para></sect1>
    <sect1 id="Face-Flags"><title>Face Flags</title><para>

   Face flags are two-element lists that specify certain properties
that are set once and only once for a give face (as opposed to specs,
which may be chained arbitrarily). Nearly all flags may be used for
button faces. Exceptions, as well as the flags that may be used for
title and border faces, are indicated below.

    <sect1 id="Face-Specification-Flags"><title>Face Specification Flags</title><para>

  Face specification flags are two-element lists that specify certain
properties that may be chained to indicate how a face is drawn. Face
specs may be fully or partially destructive. A fully destructive spec
indicates how the whole area of the element is to be drawn, making
previous specs irrelevant. A partially destructive spec overlays part,
but not all, of the drawing area.

  All specs may be used for button faces. All but non-tiled pixmaps may
be used for titlebars, and only tiled pixmaps may be used for borders.

    <sect1 id="Faces"><title>Faces</title><para>

  Faces are a data type used to specify in detail the way in which
window decorations like the titlebar, the border and titlebar buttons
will be drawn. They are currently somewhat kludgey and
ad-hoc. However, they offer a great deal of flexibility. All faces are
set in the current decor, so multiple decors must be used to use
different faces for different windows. The low-level functionality
offered in the face primitives will rarely be needed; the
<link linkend="button-style"><function>button-style</function></link>, <link linkend="title-style"><function>title-style</function></link> and <link linkend="border-style"><function>border-style</function></link> procedures in the
(app scwm face) module provide a more convenient interface to this
functionality.

    </para></sect1>
    <sect1 id="Focus-Styles"><title>Focus Styles</title><para>


   Scwm supports several focus styles, which are settable
per-window. A window with the 'click focus style is click-to-focus: it
requires that the user click on it before it will receive the input
focus, and will not lose it again until some other window gains
focus. The 'mouse focus style is mouse-focus in the traditional sense
- the window will gain and lose focus as the mouse enters and leaves
it.

  'sloppy indicates the sloppy-focus style. This is like mouse-focus,
but the window will not lose the focus until another gains it. So if
you focus the window with the mouse and then let the pointer slide
into the root window or a window that has focus styles of 'click or
'none, the window will not lose the focus. This style of focus was
first introduced in fvwm.

  A focus style of 'none indicates that the window should never gain
the input focus, no matter what. This can be used for clocks,
mailboxes, and other desktop gadgets that never need keyboard input.

    </para></sect1>
    <sect1 id="Fonts"><title>Fonts</title><para>

  Fonts are first-class objects. However, anywhere that a font is
taken as an argument, a string containing an X font specification
will also be accepted, and will be automatically converted to the
proper font object. Using the same font specifier string more than
once is not inefficient, as caching ensures that font objects are
shared.

    </para></sect1>
    <sect1 id="Hooks"><title>Hooks</title><para>

  Hooks are used throughout scwm to provide a convenient mechanism for
user callbacks on particular events. Fundamentally, a hook is just a
variable that contains a list of procedures that are called in order
when the relevant event occurs. However, several convenience macros
are provided for manipulating hooks; see <link linkend="add-hook-x"><function>add-hook!</function></link>, <link linkend="remove-hook-x"><function>remove-hook!</function></link>,
<link linkend="reset-hook-x"><function>reset-hook!</function></link>, and <link linkend="run-hook"><function>run-hook</function></link>. 

    </para></sect1>
    <sect1 id="Image-Loaders"><title>Image Loaders</title><para>

  Different loaders are available for various images types. <link linkend="load-xbm"><function>load-xbm</function></link>
and <link linkend="load-xpm"><function>load-xpm</function></link> load X bitmaps and X pixmaps respectively. The user may
register other image loaders using the extension or the special string
"default" for the loader to be tried for an image that cannot be
loaded any other way.

    </para></sect1>
    <sect1 id="Images"><title>Images</title><para>

  Images are first-class objects. However, anywhere that an image is
taken as an argument, a string containing a filename will also be
accepted, and will be automatically converted to the proper image
object by loading the image. Using the same image filename more than
once is not inefficient, as caching ensures that image objects are
shared.

    </para></sect1>
    <sect1 id="Input-Hooks"><title>Input Hooks</title><para>

  Input hooks are a special form of hook that is called whenever input
is available on a particular port. They are treated differently than
normal hooks - use <link linkend="add-input-hook-x"><function>add-input-hook!</function></link> and <link linkend="remove-input-hook-x"><function>remove-input-hook!</function></link> to
manipulate them. Like regular hooks and unlike timer hooks, input
hooks are not one-shot - they trigger every time input is made
available on the particular port, and do not go away until explicitly
removed. An input hook may safely remove itself from within its own
invocation.

    </para></sect1>
    <sect1 id="Interactive-specfications"><title>Interactive specfications</title><para>


   Procedures can have an interactive specification that looks like:

   <programlisting>(interactive)</programlisting>

   or 

   <programlisting>(interactive "%W")</programlisting>

   This declaration must be the first s-exp after the docstring of
   a procedure.  Primitive procedures may also have interactive
   specifications and use the SCWM_IPROC macro to support them.

   The interactive specification marks that a procedure may be
   invoked interactively (i.e., bound to a mouse or keypress event).
   The specification also is used to construct the arguments
   when the procedure is invoked in an interactive context or
   via <link linkend="call-interactively"><function>call-interactively</function></link>.  

   The meaning of the various possible substrings in the interactive
   specification are as follows:

    </para></sect1>
    <sect1 id="Key-Specifier"><title>Key Specifier</title><para>

   A key specifier is a string denoting a keystroke, perhaps including
modifiers.  The available modifiers include S-, C-, M-, A-, H-, and s-
for Shift, Control, Meta, Alt, Hyper, and Super, respectively.  They
can be combined arbitrarily, and in any order, but should precede the
key name. They may also be combined without the dash separator;  e.g.,
CSM-Left refers to the keysym "Left" with the control, shift, and meta
modifiers.

When a key specifier is being used to indicate a binding, the
additional special modifier *- may be used; it indicates that the key
should be bound with every possible modifier combination, including
possibly no modifiers. *- may not be combined with any other modifier.  
    </para></sect1>
    <sect1 id="Menu-Looks"><title>Menu Looks</title><para>


  Menus have an associated menu look, which determines how the menus
are drawn.  Menu look objects are created by dynamically-loaded
C modules.  For example, the xpm-menus module creates a variable
<link linkend="xpm-shaped-menu-look"><function>xpm-shaped-menu-look</function></link> that specifies that the menu should be drawn
using that code.  <link linkend="copy-menu-look"><function>copy-menu-look</function></link> can be used to copy a menu
look and change some of its properties.

    <sect1 id="SCWMEXEC-Protocol"><title>SCWMEXEC Protocol</title><para>

  Scwm supports a protocol for other programs to send commands to the
window manager. Programs send ordinary configuration language
expressions and are returned a string representation of the return
value, and the output and error output generated, if any.

  For more information on how to make use of this protocol, see the
documentation for the scwmexec and scwmrepl programs, the scwm.el
emacs interaction mode, the libscwmexec library, and the details of
the SCWMEXEC protocol (as documented in
<filename>doc/scwmexec.proto</filename>).

    </para></sect1>
    <sect1 id="Shadow-and-Highlight-Factors"><title>Shadow and Highlight Factors</title><para>

  Many decorations are supposed to look "three-dimensional".
To implement this, the decorations use three colors: the specified
decoration color, a brighter "highlight" color, and a darker "shadow"
color.  For "raised" decorations, the top and left edges are drawn in
the highlight color, and the bottom and right edges are drawn in the
shadow color; this is reversed for "sunken" decorations.

The highlight and shadow colors are computed from the decoration color
using the highlight and shadow factors.  The highlight factor should be
a floating-point number greater than 1.  If the highlight factor is
1, then the highlight color is the same as the decoration color;
the larger the highlight factor, the brighter the highlight color.
The shadow factor should be a floating-point number between 0 and 1.  If 
the shadow factor is 1, then the shadow color is the same as the
decoration color; the smaller the shadow factor, the darker the
shadow color.

(It is actually possible to give a highlight factor which is less than
1 (which makes the highlight color darker than the decoration color)
and a shadow factor which is greater than 1 (which makes the shadow
color brighter than the decoration color); the effect is to reverse
"raised" and "sunken" elements throughout the user interface.)

A theme is a named collection of window manager settings.

    </para></sect1>
    <sect1 id="Timer-Hooks"><title>Timer Hooks</title><para>

  Timer hooks are a special form of hook that is called after a
specified amount of time has passed. They are treated differently than
normal hooks - use <link linkend="add-timer-hook-x"><function>add-timer-hook!</function></link> and <link linkend="remove-timer-hook-x"><function>remove-timer-hook!</function></link> to
manipulate them. Timer hooks, unlike regular hooks, are one-shot -
once the time limit expires and the timer hook is triggered, it is
removed.

    </para></sect1>
    <sect1 id="Viewports"><title>Viewports</title><para>

  The current viewport is the area of the current desk that may be
seen on the physical screen. Since a desk can be larger than the
physical screen size, the viewport can move around the desk.

  Viewports give rise to two concepts of coordinates.  A viewport
coordinate is relative to the current viewport (i.e., it is the 
coordinate you actually see on the screen).  A virtual coordinate
is relative to the origin of the current desk.

    </para></sect1>
    <sect1 id="Window-Context"><title>Window Context</title><para>


  When actions are triggered by mouse or keyboard events, or menu
actions from menus originally popped up by mouse or keyboard events, a
context window is saved, which is used as the default for window
operations that are not passed their optional window argument. This
allows the user to easily bind actions to events without worrying
about passing around the window argument.

  However, it is unclear whether behind-the-scenes magic like this is
a good idea.  The merit of this approach is still under consideration;
it may be changed entirely. 
    </para></sect1>
    <sect1 id="Window-Style"><title>Window Style</title><para>

  Window styles encapsulate the behaviour and appearance of windows.
They are applied to windows arbitrarily so different windows can
use different styles at the same time.  Numerous options are permitted
for window styles.  For some of the below options you will
need to use the appropriate module to make the options available. 
The options include at least:

    <sect1 id="Windows"><title>Windows</title><para>

  Windows are the most important scwm data type. A window object
represents an on-screen window that scwm is managing, and is used to
perform window management operations on the window, as well as to set
options and retrieve information about the window.
 
    </para></sect1>
    <sect1 id="X-atoms"><title>X atoms</title><para>

   X windows allows certain entities (for example, X properties [FIXME: XREF
to X properties]) to have arbitrary names. To avoid exchanging strings ever so
often, these names are in fact X atoms.

New X atoms can be created, or old ones retrieved simply by specifying
the string the atom stands for. An X atom can also be converted back to a
string. Scwm provides primitives for these actions. 
    </para></sect1>
    <sect1 id="X-Properties"><title>X Properties</title><para>

   X has a notion of window properties, which live in the X
server. X window properties are often used to implement protocols
between applications and the window manager, which can have several
levels of standardization, from official X standard, to standardized
by some other organization, to made up informally by groups of
programmers, to specific to one window manager, to specific to an
individual, or installation.

  Scwm already internally implements many of these protocols,
including all X standard protocols, as well as the Motif and Open Look
protocols. However, the user should be able to implement any of these
he likes, including making up his own for personal use.

  This is possible through the low-level X property interface. Scwm has
one procedure to get, and set them, respectively.

this is a version of map that allows the mapping function to return
any number of elements to be inserted into the result list, including

  <para>
  Return a procedure that places a window at the pointer position.
If the keyword argument OFFSET is specified, it is interpreted as a
list of x and y offsets to add to the pointer position. If the keyword
argument PROPORTIONAL-OFFSET is specified, it is interpreted as a list
of numbers to multiply by the window's width and height, and is
treated as an extra offset.The defaults are (0 0) for OFFSET and (-0.5
-0.5) for PROPORTIONAL-OFFSET, with the result that by default the
window is centered at the mouse pointer position by the returned
procedure.

If SWITCH is true, the returned procedure will switch to the virtual
desk and viewport of its window argument before placing it. This is
the default. If RETURN is false, the returned procedure will switch
back to the previous desk and viewport after placing the window. The
default is false.

See also the related <link linkend="place-at-point"><function>place-at-point</function></link> procedure which directly places
a window at the pointer position.

  <para>
  Run CMD using /bin/sh -c CMD and return the exit status.
The CMD is run synchronously, and Bourne-shell meta characters
are interpreted by /bin/sh.  E.g., to start CMD in the background,
use a trailing "&amp;" character.  See also guile's <link linkend="system"><function>system</function></link>, but note
that it may permit signals on the controlling tty to be seen
by children (observed on Linux, Free/NetBSD, but not on Solaris or HP/UX.
This may be a bug (not meeting POSIX.2 specifications).
Returns the child-pid, or <literal>#f</literal> if the fork fails.

MWM sets the button's mwm flag (see <link linkend="set-button-mwm-flag-x"><function>set-button-mwm-flag!</function></link>.
This function also takes the keyword arguments #:justify, #:relief,
#:vertical-justify, #:use-style-of, #:solid, #:gradient, #:h-gradient,
#:v-gradient, #:relief-pattern, #:vector, #:pixmap, and #:tiled-pixmap,
with effects as described under the `Face Flags' and `Face
Specification Flags' concepts (with the additions that #:tiled-pixmap
is an always-tiled pixmap, #:vector is a synonym for #:relief-pattern,
and #:h-gradient and #:v-gradient are horizontal and vertical
gradients).  These extra keyword arguments can either be included
in the main argument list, or lists of these arguments can be used
as the ACTIVE-UP, ACTIVE-DOWN, or INACTIVE arguments.

  Cascade WINDOWS according to several parameters.  
Cascading places the windows in a diagonal order starting at
START-POS, (0 0) by default. Each window's size is limited to
MAX-SIZE, by default the display size.

RESIZE may be <literal>#f</literal>, 'shrink-only or 'always, indicating that the windows
should never be resized, that they should be resized to the max-size
only if they are bigger, or that they should always be resized to the
max size. The default is 'shrink-only.

RAISE may be <literal>#f</literal>, <literal>#t</literal>, or 'restack-only, indicating that the windows
should not be moved in the stacking order; that they should be raised
on top of other windows and placed in the cascade order with the upper
left window lowest in the stacking order; or that they should be
restacked as for <literal>#t</literal> but not raised above other windows,
respectively. The default is 'restack-only.

X-INCREMENT may be an integer or a procedure that takes a window and
returns an integer, and which will be applied to a window to get the
horizontal offset for the next in the cascade order. The default is
the sum of the window's border width and title height.

Y-INCREMENT may be an integer or a procedure that takes a window and
returns an integer, and which will be applied to a window to get the
vertical offset for the next in the cascade order. The default is the
sum of the window's border width and title height.

  Images are cached by both name and full pathname. It is
remotely possible that the file that should be used for a particular
name will change, for example if you alter the image file or change
your image path. For this unlikely eventuality,
<link linkend="clear-image-cache-entry"><function>clear-image-cache-entry</function></link> is provided - it removes the image
associated with <parameter>name</parameter> from the image cache

  <para>
  Places <parameter>win</parameter> using fvwm2's "ReallySmart" algorithm.
The placement is just as if being placed by fvwm2's SmartPlacement,
as if SmartPlacementIsReallySmart were in effect. That is, it
tries to place the window so as to minimize its area of
overlap with other windows. Several parameters give different
weight to various kinds of windows, but they are not tunable
at runtime currently. If it fails to place the window, it
returns <literal>#f</literal>; otherwise it returns <literal>#t</literal>.
This is called as part of <link linkend="default-placement-proc"><function>default-placement-proc</function></link>.  It could also be
used in user-defined placement procedures (see
<link linkend="set-window-placement-proc-x"><function>set-window-placement-proc!</function></link>).

POS is a list of x and y virtual coordinates in that order. The
viewport coordinates returned will be in the same format and will be a
integral multiples of the desk size. If POS is not contained in any
valid viewport, for instance if it includes coordinates greater than
zero or greater than the desk size times the display size, the nearest
viewport will be returned instead.

  <para>
  Deiconify <parameter>win</parameter>.
Hides its icon, and shows its regular window.
<parameter>win</parameter> defaults to the window context in the usual way if not
specified.
If <parameter>x</parameter> and <parameter>y</parameter> are given, then move <parameter>win</parameter> to virtual position (<parameter>x</parameter> . <parameter>y</parameter>)
before de-iconifying.  If <parameter>x</parameter> is specified, <parameter>y</parameter> must be specified, too.
These arguments are useful since <link linkend="move-window"><function>move-window</function></link> and <link linkend="move-to"><function>move-to</function></link> will
refer to the icon window (not the frame window) if a window is iconified.
Without being able to specify a position on de-iconification, the window
cannot, e.g., cleanly be brought back onto the current viewport.

The string is usable as a key binding string.  Modifiers
are listed first, separated by "-" followed by a "-" and the

  Retrieve the window context or select interactively.
If there is no window context, a window is selected interactively.
The boolean <parameter>select?</parameter> argument (default <literal>#t</literal>) determines whether or not a
window should be selected interactively if there is no current window
context. The <parameter>release?</parameter> argument (default <literal>#t</literal>) determines whether or not
interactive selection (if any) should wait for a mouse release event
or just a press. The latter behavior is useful if the action being
performed on the window is an interactive one involving mouse
drags. The <parameter>cursor</parameter> argument is either a cursor object or <literal>#t</literal> to use
the "skull and crossbones" cursor, or <literal>#f</literal> to use the standard
circle cursor.

  Select a WINDOW and a NONANT, defaulting to the current window context.  
If the WINDOW is not specified and there is no window context, 
perform interactive selection.  If WINDOW is passed in but 
NONANT is not specified, the center nonant is used.  The nonant
is stored as an object-property of the window for use with the
window-selection and constraints modules.

If the RESIZE argument is true, the resulting procedure will
interactively resize the window immediately after placing it. If
SWITCH is true, the returned procedure will switch to the virtual desk
and viewport of its window argument before placing it. This is the
default. If RETURN is false, the returned procedure will switch back
to the previous desk and viewport after placing the window. The
default is false.

  <title>Description</title>
  <para>
  Return a newly created menuitem object using the given arguments.
<parameter>label</parameter> is a string giving the main text label of the menu item;
<parameter>action</parameter> is a procedure or menu object -- if it is a procedure, it gets
invoked when the menuitem is selected, if it is a menu object, that
menu is attached as a submenu from the enclosing menu that the created
menuitem is put in.  You can also force <parameter>action</parameter> to be treated as a
submenu by setting <parameter>submenu?</parameter> to <literal>#t</literal>.
<parameter>extra-label</parameter> is extra text describing the menu item -- often this
contains a shortcut key description, or some other descriptive text.
<parameter>picture-above</parameter> and <parameter>picture-left</parameter> are picture objects which correspond to
images to display within the bounding region of the menuitem.
<parameter>hover-action</parameter> and <parameter>unhover-action</parameter> are procedures to be invoked when the
mouse pointer hovers over the item and is moved away after hovering
over the item, respectively.
<parameter>hotkey-prefs</parameter> is a string listing preferred alphanumeric shortcut-keys
for the given menu-item; the menu creation routine uses these as hints
for assigning shortcut keys to the various menuitems.

  UI-CONSTRAINT-CLASS specified the type of constraint to be created.
WIN-LIST specifies the windows to be constrained.  Returns a new constraint
object that is NOT enabled.  errors if UI-CONSTRAINT-CLASS is not valid.
Returned objects are #(obid-ui-constraint CLASS CN ENABLED? LIST-OF-WINDOWS OPTS BUT DHOOKS)
The OPTS param is a spot for optional data to be specified by the ui-constraint-class 
constructor.  If data returns from that constructor in list form, the first element of
the list is assumed to be the CN and the cdr is stuck in OPTS.
BUT may contain a reference to the gtk button for the constraint instance in the 
toggle menu if that feature is in use.
DHOOKS is a list of hook procedures that should be called when the enable is changed on this
constraint.  These hook functions may only be added after an instance is created.
SIDE-EFFECT: adds new instance object to the global list.

  <para>
  Creates a new ui-constraint-class object.
CTR takes a set of arguments and installs the appropriate constraints in the solver.  A number of
windows should be included in those arguments, falling somewhere in the range of NUM-WINDOWS.  
NUM-WINDOWS is a list of '(min-win max-win) where the values specify the minimum and maximum number
of windows which may be constrained.  Max-win may optionally be specified as a non-number (preferably
as <literal>#t</literal>), in which case the constraint is taken to be able to constraint an infinite number of windows.
SATISFIED-PROC is a procedure that takes a single argument, the cn, and tells if it is satisfied
UI-CTR should return the arguments (as a list) for CTR to build the constraint with.  UI-CTR should
return <literal>#f</literal> if the user cancels the construction or fails to follow the interface correctly.  PIXMAP-NAME
is the name of the pixmap to associate with this constraint-class in the user interface.
MENUNAME-PROC is a proc that takes a UI-CONSTRAINT as an arg and returns the name that should be used
for the constraint in the toggle menu.  
This routine returns a new constraint class object based on the parameters.
SIDE-EFFECT: addes new class obj to the global class list.

  <para>
  Popup a window list menu and permit a selection to be made.
ONLY and EXCEPT are procedures that control which windows will appear
in the list -- see <link linkend="list-windows"><function>list-windows</function></link> for details. BY-STACKING, BY-FOCUS
and REVERSE control the order in which windows appear. See
<link linkend="list-windows"><function>list-windows</function></link> for more on these as well.

PROC is the procedure which will be called on the selected window. 

FLASH-WINDOW-PROC and UNFLASH-WINDOW-PROC are set as the hover-action
and unhover-action (respectively) of the items in the menu.  (See
<link linkend="menuitem"><function>menuitem</function></link>.)

If SHOW-GEOMETRY is <literal>#t</literal>, the geometries of the windows will be listed
in each menuitem.  

If SHOW-LAST-FOCUS-TIME is <literal>#t</literal>, the last focus time of the windows will be listed
in each menuitem.

If SHOW-MINI-ICON is <literal>#t</literal>, the mini-icon of the windows will be
displayed with each menuitem.

If WARP-TO-FIRST is <literal>#t</literal>, the mouse pointer will be warped to the first
menuitem (see <link linkend="popup-menu"><function>popup-menu</function></link>).  

If BY-RESOURCE is <literal>#t</literal>, the window list is split into sublists by the
window resource name (this is also the behaviour if too many windows
exist to fit vertically on the menu).

If ENUMERATE-HOT-KEYS is <literal>#t</literal>, then add alpha-numeric hot keys for the window-list.
For the hotkey, the characters 1 through 9 are used first, followed by
the letters a through z.  Currently this is turned off if BY-RESOURCE is <literal>#t</literal>.

  <title>Description</title>
  <para>
  Allow specification of message-window behavior for standard actions.

ACTION specifies the action for which this behavior should be
used. Currently, 'interactive-move and 'interactive-resize are the
only useful values. 

ENABLE is a boolean value inidicating whether to use a message window
for that action at all.

GRAVITY indicates which point on the message window is used as the
control point for placing it. See `gravity->alignmnents' for a list of
valid gravity specs.

If FOLLOW-WINDOW is true, the message window will track the window on
which an action is being performed, if applicable. In this case,
POSITION is ignored; OFFSET is taken as a list of the X and Y offsets
from the window's top left corner, and PROPORTIONAL-OFFSET is taken as
a list of factors to multiply by the window's size. For instance, an
OFFSET of (0 0) and a PROPORTIONAL-OFFSET of (0.5 0.5) will place the
message window at the center of of the window being operated on.

However, if FOLLOW-WINDOW is false, or there is no applicable window,
POSITION is interpreted as a list of x, y coordinates at which to
place the message window.

These options are cumulative for repeated calls to
<link linkend="message-window-options"><function>message-window-options</function></link> for the same action.

  <para>
  Return a procedure that places a window near the window returned by WINDOW-GETTER.

If RELATIVE-TO is specified, it gives a symbolic location in the
existing window returned by WINDOW-GETTER to use as the control point
for the window placement.  RELATIVE-TO may be any of northwest north
northeast west center east southwest south southeast.

If OFFSET is specified, it is interpreted as a list of x and y offsets
to add to the control point.

If PROPORTIONAL-OFFSET is specified, it is interpreted as a list of
numbers to multiply by the being-placed window's width and height, and
is treated as an extra offset added to the control point.

The defaults are (0 0) for OFFSET and (-0.5 -0.5) for
PROPORTIONAL-OFFSET, with the result that by default the window is
centered at the control point of the existing window.

  Return the percent of WIN currently in the viewport as a real in [0,100].
Note that this does not consider other windows which may
obscure WIN;  it only checks what fraction of WIN would be visible
if it were on top (unobscured).

  <para>
  Place WIN at the pointer position.

If the keyword argument OFFSET is specified, it is interpreted as a
list of x and y offsets to add to the pointer position.

If the keyword argument PROPORTIONAL-OFFSET is specified, it is
interpreted as a list of numbers to multiply by the window's width and
height, and is treated as an extra offset.

The defaults are (0 0) for OFFSET and (-0.5 -0.5) for
PROPORTIONAL-OFFSET, with the result that by default the window is
centered at the mouse pointer position.

  <para>
  Places <parameter>win</parameter> just as if being placed by fvwm2's RandomPlacement.
This placement is not truly random; it is based on two state variables
which are incremented for the x and y coordinates, and which wrap
around once a window would be forced off the screen. The placement is
fairly arbitrary, but always succeeds, and so avoids user
interaction. <literal>#t</literal> is always returned.
This is called as part of <link linkend="default-placement-proc"><function>default-placement-proc</function></link>.  It could also be
used in user-defined placement procedures (see
<link linkend="set-window-placement-proc-x"><function>set-window-placement-proc!</function></link>).

your X server goes awry (and otherwise you would have to restart your
X server).  Use if scwmexec or scwmrepl are not returning (e.g.,
if your Emacs hangs when you try evaluating a scwm expression).

SYMS is a list of all the preference settings you wish to be included in
the string.  It defaults to the value of <link linkend="scwm-options"><function>scwm-options</function></link>, the list of all
the options in the current session.  At present this means that if some
modules are not loaded, those options will not be included.
The returned string will contain multiple S-expressions, one for each Scwm preference
value.

  Run CMD using /bin/sh -c CMD and return a list: (exit-status child-pid).
Note that the child pid is of the executed sh, not CMD.
The CMD is run synchronously, and Bourne-shell meta characters
are interpreted by /bin/sh.  E.g., to start CMD in the background,
use a trailing "&amp;" character.  See also guile's <link linkend="system"><function>system</function></link>, but note
that it may permit signals on the controlling tty to be seen
by children (observed on Linux, Free/NetBSD, but not on Solaris or HP/UX.
This may be a bug (not meeting POSIX.2 specifications).

Create a synthetic event of a press of mouse button <parameter>button</parameter>. The usual
mouse button specification format (with modifiers) is used. Send the
event to window <parameter>win</parameter> if specified; otherwise the window to be used
defaults to the window context in the usual way. By default, both a
press and a release are sent---a click. <parameter>kind</parameter> can be one of 'press, 'release,
'click, 'desk-press, 'desk-release, or 'desk-click.
If <parameter>dx</parameter> or <parameter>dy</parameter> is set, that value is used as the offset within <parameter>win</parameter> for
the button events to occur.  If one is not specified or <literal>#f</literal>, then the
pointer offset of that coordinate is used instead.
<parameter>propagate?</parameter> indicates whether the propagate flag is set
on the event; the default is <literal>#f</literal>. You should not have to worry about
this unless you know what it means.

  Register Scwm with the session manager, and return the client id.
The return value is either an id string, or <literal>#f</literal> if the session manager could not be
initialized - <link linkend="SM-error-message"><function>SM-error-message</function></link> can be used to get more information in this
case.
If Scwm is already registered, this function just returns the client id.

  <para>
  Places <parameter>win</parameter> using fvwm2's SmartPlacement algorithm.
The placement is just as if SmartPlacementIsReallySmart were not in
effect. That is, it tries to place the window so that it does not
overlap any other. If it fails to do so, it returns <literal>#f</literal>; otherwise it
returns <literal>#t</literal>.
This is called as part of <link linkend="default-placement-proc"><function>default-placement-proc</function></link>.  It could also be
used in user-defined placement procedures (see
<link linkend="set-window-placement-proc-x"><function>set-window-placement-proc!</function></link>).

The DESK option, defaulting to the current desk, specifies which desk;
ALL-VIEWPORTS, when true indicates that the windows in all viewports
of this desk should be tiled, otherwise only the current viewport
is tiled. 

The options ONLY, EXCEPT, BY-STACKING, BY-FOCUS and REVERSE indicate
the windows to use and the order to use them in, as with
<link linkend="list-windows"><function>list-windows</function></link>. However, unless IGNORE-DEFAULT-EXCEPTIONS is <literal>#t</literal>,
transient, maximized, sticky and iconified windows will be always be

If ORDER is 'horizontal, the windows will be tiled in row-major order;
if it is 'vertical they will be tiled in column-major oder.

RESIZE may be <literal>#f</literal>, 'shrink-only or 'always, indicating that the windows
should never be resized, that they should be resized to the max-size
only if they are bigger, or that they should always be resized to the
max size. The default is 'shrink-only.

RAISE may be <literal>#f</literal>, <literal>#t</literal>, or 'restack-only, indicating that the windows
should not be moved in the stacking order; that they should be raised
on top of other windows and placed in the tile order with the upper
left window lowest in the stacking order; or that they should be
restacked as for <literal>#t</literal> but not raised above other windows,
respectively. The default is 'restack-only.

  Set the title style in the current decor.
FONT is the window title font, a font object or a string.
HEIGHT is the height of the title bar, in points.
JUSTIFY is one of 'left, 'right, or 'center.
This function also takes the keyword arguments #:relief, #:solid,
#:gradient, #:h-gradient, #:v-gradient, and #:pixmap, with effects
as described under the `Face Flags' and `Face Specification Flags'
concepts (except that #:pixmap is always tiled, and #:h-gradient
and #:v-gradient are horizontal and vertical gradients).  These
extra keyword arguments can either be included in the main argument
list, or lists of these arguments can be used as the ACTIVE-UP,
ACTIVE-DOWN, or INACTIVE arguments.  For instance:
  (title-style #:solid "red" #:inactive (list #:solid "green"))
would set the title to be red in either active state, and green
in the inactive state, leaving FONT, HEIGHT, and JUSTIFY in their
current state, and returning everything else about the title
to their default state.

PROC is a procedure that takes a single window argument. The return
value is also a procedure of one one window argument which has the
same effect, except that it may switch to the desk and viewport of the
passed window before executing PROC, and may return to the previous
desk and viewport, depending on the values of SWITCH and RETURN

  <para>
  Return a list, (%x %y), for the desired pointer placement for WIN.
The percentages are of the window size, and are gotten by using
the 'warp-placement object-property of WIN;  they default to (20 20)
if no such property is set. To change the default for all your windows
you can do something like:
  (add-hook! after-new-window-hook 
    (lambda (win) 
      (set-object-property! win 'warp-placement '(80 20))))

return a list of the horizontal resolution, the vertical resolution,
the number of planes on the current screen (i.e. the bit depth), the
bits per color supported by the hardware, the visual class (one of
"StaticGray", "GrayScale", "StaticColor", "PseudoColor", "DirectColor"
or "TrueColor") and a boolean indicating whether the display is color.
The resolutions mentioned above should in theory be pixels per
centimeter, rounded to the nearest integer. These parameters can be
used for various workarounds or conditional decisions in a scwmrc to
be shared among multiple machines.
