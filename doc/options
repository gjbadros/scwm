SCWM command line options:

(sorry about the mixture of long and short options, I'll switch to
using getopt to parse them ASAP)


   -debug : enable lots of debugging messages.

       -s : run only on on the first screen of the display

   -d dpy : run on display dpy

  -f file : read startum commands from teh specified file instead of
            ".scwmrc" or "system.scwmrc".

  -e expr : evaluate Scheme expression expr instead of reading from
            ".scwmrc" or "system.scwmrc". Multiple -e and -f options
            may be specified on a single command line and in this case
            will be processed in the order in which they were specified.

       -i : starts scwm in interactive mode - the .scwmrc or system.scwmrc 
            file is read as usual (unless of course there are -f or -e 
            options.)

       -h :  prints a usage message and exits

-blackout : blacks the screen out to hide the initial capture

       -v : prints the version and exits
