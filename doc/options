SCWM command line options:

Now done with getopt_long where available or compatibly
otherwise. This means that there are both short and GNU-style long
options for ecverything.


-D | --debug            : enable lots of debugging messages.

-s | --single-screen    : run only on on the first screen of the display.

-d | --display  dpy     : run on display dpy.

-f | --file  file       : read startup commands from the specified file 
         instead of ".scwmrc" or "system.scwmrc".

-e | --expression  expr : evaluate Scheme expression expr instead of reading 
         from ".scwmrc" or "system.scwmrc". Multiple -e and -f options
         may be specified on a single command line and in this case
         will be processed in the order in which they were specified.

-i | --interactive      : starts scwm in interactive mode - the .scwmrc or 
         system.scwmrc file is read as usual (unless of course there are -f 
         or -e options.)

-h | --help             :  prints a usage message and exits.

-b | --blackout         : blacks the screen out to hide the initial capture.

-v | --version          : prints the version and exits.
