Colors
-

  Colors are first-class objects. However, anywhere that a color is
taken as an argument, a string containing an X color specification
will also be accepted, and will be automatically converted to the
proper color object. Using the same color specifier string more than
once is not inefficient, as caching ensures that color objects are
shared.

Creating themes
-
Currently, the best documentation on themes is the source code;
however, here are a few notes.
To create a theme, create a new subdirectory of a directory in
`*theme-path*' (you'll probably want to add a private directory to 
`*theme-path*').  This subdirectory should be named the same as the
theme.  This subdirectory must contain (at least) a file named
theme.scm.  This file must create a module named
(app scwm theme your-theme-name), and define (in this module)
a theme object named `the-theme'.  See the existing themes for
examples of what you can do when building `the-theme'.

[From scheme/theme-impl.scm:29]


Decors
-


  Decors are a means of managing the abundance of visual appearance
options for windows. In the original Fvwm code, there were many
options that could only be set globally, although they affected window
appearance. Decors are a compromise between leaving them global and
making them fully settable per window. These quasi-global options may
be set in a particular decor, and a decor may be attached to one or
more windows.

  Having to use decors to change certain aspects of the look and feel
is confusing. Scwm will probably move to some way of making these
options directly settable per-window at some point, especially if we
can figure out a way to not increase the memory overhead much.

[From src/decor.c:57]


Desks
-


  Multiple virtual desktops are supported. A virtual desktop may be
bigger than the physical screen, in which case the current viewport on
the desktop may be moved around, as described in the Viewports entry.
Desks are identified by integers. There is currently an arbitrary
limit on the number of desks, but it should be much higher than anyone
will ever need. You can change the current desk with
`set-current-desk!'; find out what the current desk is with
`current-desk'; and set the desk a window is on with
`set-window-desk!'.

[From src/deskpage.c:54]


Event Contexts
-


There are various event contexts that are used as arguments
to the binding procedures.  Among these are:

  'window
  'title
  'icon
  'root
  'frame-corners
  'frame-sides
  'client-window
  'root-window
  'left-button-N  (N=1-5)
  'right-button-N (N=1-5)

explanations of what these contexts mean!

Face Flags
-

   Face flags are two-element lists that specify certain properties
that are set once and only once for a give face (as opposed to specs,
which may be chained arbitrarily). Nearly all flags may be used for
button faces. Exceptions, as well as the flags that may be used for
title and border faces, are indicated below.

Face Specification Flags
-

  Face specification flags are two-element lists that specify certain
properties that may be chained to indicate how a face is drawn. Face
specs may be fully or partially destructive. A fully destructive spec
indicates how the whole area of the element is to be drawn, making
previous specs irrelevant. A partially destructive spec overlays part,
but not all, of the drawing area.

  All specs may be used for button faces. All but non-tiled pixmaps may
be used for titlebars, and only tiled pixmaps may be used for borders.

Faces
-

  Faces are a data type used to specify in detail the way in which
window decorations like the titlebar, the border and titlebar buttons
will be drawn. They are currently somewhat kludgey and
ad-hoc. However, they offer a great deal of flexibility. All faces are
set in the current decor, so multiple decors must be used to use
different faces for different windows. The low-level functionality
offered in the face primitives will rarely be needed; the
`button-style', `title-style' and `border-style' procedures in the
(app scwm face) module provide a more convenient interface to this
functionality.

[From src/face.c:39]


Focus Styles
-


   Scwm supports several focus styles, which are settable
per-window. A window with the 'click focus style is click-to-focus: it
requires that the user click on it before it will receive the input
focus, and will not lose it again until some other window gains
focus. The 'mouse focus style is mouse-focus in the traditional sense
- the window will gain and lose focus as the mouse enters and leaves
it.

  'sloppy indicates the sloppy-focus style. This is like mouse-focus,
but the window will not lose the focus until another gains it. So if
you focus the window with the mouse and then let the pointer slide
into the root window or a window that has focus styles of 'click or
'none, the window will not lose the focus. This style of focus was
first introduced in fvwm.

  A focus style of 'none indicates that the window should never gain
the input focus, no matter what. This can be used for clocks,
mailboxes, and other desktop gadgets that never need keyboard input.

[From src/window.c:3455]


Fonts
-

  Fonts are first-class objects. However, anywhere that a font is
taken as an argument, a string containing an X font specification
will also be accepted, and will be automatically converted to the
proper font object. Using the same font specifier string more than
once is not inefficient, as caching ensures that font objects are
shared.

[From src/font.c:47]


Hooks
-

  Hooks are used throughout scwm to provide a convenient mechanism for
user callbacks on particular events. Fundamentally, a hook is just a
variable that contains a list of procedures that are called in order
when the relevant event occurs. However, several convenience macros
are provided for manipulating hooks; see `add-hook!', `remove-hook!',
`reset-hook!', and `run-hook'. 

[From src/callbacks.c:302]


Image Loaders
-

  Different loaders are available for various images types. `load-xbm'
and `load-xpm' load X bitmaps and X pixmaps respectively. The user may
register other image loaders using the extension or the special string
"default" for the loader to be tried for an image that cannot be
loaded any other way.

[From src/image.c:260]


Images
-

  Images are first-class objects. However, anywhere that an image is
taken as an argument, a string containing a filename will also be
accepted, and will be automatically converted to the proper image
object by loading the image. Using the same image filename more than
once is not inefficient, as caching ensures that image objects are
shared.

[From src/image.c:111]


Input Hooks
-

  Input hooks are a special form of hook that is called whenever input
is available on a particular port. They are treated differently than
normal hooks - use `add-input-hook!' and `remove-input-hook!' to
manipulate them. Like regular hooks and unlike timer hooks, input
hooks are not one-shot - they trigger every time input is made
available on the particular port, and do not go away until explicitly
removed. An input hook may safely remove itself from within its own
invocation.

[From src/callbacks.c:891]


Interactive specifications
-


   Procedures can have an interactive specification that looks like:

   <programlisting>(interactive)</programlisting>

   or 

   <programlisting>(interactive "%W")</programlisting>

   This declaration must be the first s-exp after the docstring of
   a procedure.  Primitive procedures may also have interactive
   specifications and use the SCWM_IPROC macro to support them.

   The interactive specification marks that a procedure may be
   invoked interactively (i.e., bound to a mouse or keypress event).
   The specification also is used to construct the arguments
   when the procedure is invoked in an interactive context or
   via `call-interactively'.  

   The meaning of the various possible substrings in the interactive
   specification are as follows:

<table colsep="1" rowsep="0" frame="all">

Key Specifier
-

   A key specifier is a string denoting a keystroke, perhaps including
modifiers.  The available modifiers include S-, C-, M-, A-, H-, and s-
for Shift, Control, Meta, Alt, Hyper, and Super, respectively.  They
can be combined arbitrarily, and in any order, but should precede the
key name. They may also be combined without the dash separator;  e.g.,
CSM-Left refers to the keysym "Left" with the control, shift, and meta
modifiers.

When a key specifier is being used to indicate a binding, the
additional special modifier *- may be used; it indicates that the key
should be bound with every possible modifier combination, including
possibly no modifiers. *- may not be combined with any other modifier.  
[From src/binding.c:123]


Menu Looks
-


  Menus have an associated menu look, which determines how the menus
are drawn.  Menu look objects are created by dynamically-loaded
C modules.  For example, the xpm-menus module creates a variable
`xpm-shaped-menu-look' that specifies that the menu should be drawn
using that code.  `copy-menu-look' can be used to copy a menu
look and change some of its properties.

SCWMEXEC Protocol
-

  Scwm supports a protocol for other programs to send commands to the
window manager. Programs send ordinary configuration language
expressions and are returned a string representation of the return
value, and the output and error output generated, if any.

  For more information on how to make use of this protocol, see the
documentation for the scwmexec and scwmrepl programs, the scwm.el
emacs interaction mode, the libscwmexec library, and the details of
the SCWMEXEC protocol (as documented in
<filename>doc/scwmexec.proto</filename>).

Shadow and Highlight Factors
-

  Many decorations are supposed to look "three-dimensional".
To implement this, the decorations use three colors: the specified
decoration color, a brighter "highlight" color, and a darker "shadow"
color.  For "raised" decorations, the top and left edges are drawn in
the highlight color, and the bottom and right edges are drawn in the
shadow color; this is reversed for "sunken" decorations.

The highlight and shadow colors are computed from the decoration color
using the highlight and shadow factors.  The highlight factor should be
a floating-point number greater than 1.  If the highlight factor is
1, then the highlight color is the same as the decoration color;
the larger the highlight factor, the brighter the highlight color.
The shadow factor should be a floating-point number between 0 and 1.  If 
the shadow factor is 1, then the shadow color is the same as the
decoration color; the smaller the shadow factor, the darker the
shadow color.

(It is actually possible to give a highlight factor which is less than
1 (which makes the highlight color darker than the decoration color)
and a shadow factor which is greater than 1 (which makes the shadow
color brighter than the decoration color); the effect is to reverse
"raised" and "sunken" elements throughout the user interface.)

Themes

A theme is a named collection of window manager settings.
Themes are still under development, but they are planned to

global settings.

Timer Hooks
-

  Timer hooks are a special form of hook that is called after a
specified amount of time has passed. They are treated differently than
normal hooks - use `add-timer-hook!' and `remove-timer-hook!' to
manipulate them. Timer hooks, unlike regular hooks, are one-shot -
once the time limit expires and the timer hook is triggered, it is
removed.

[From src/callbacks.c:747]


Viewports
-

  The current viewport is the area of the current desk that may be
seen on the physical screen. Since a desk can be larger than the
physical screen size, the viewport can move around the desk.

  Viewports give rise to two concepts of coordinates.  A viewport
coordinate is relative to the current viewport (i.e., it is the 
coordinate you actually see on the screen).  A virtual coordinate
is relative to the origin of the current desk.

[From src/deskpage.c:91]


Window Context
-


  When actions are triggered by mouse or keyboard events, or menu
actions from menus originally popped up by mouse or keyboard events, a
context window is saved, which is used as the default for window
operations that are not passed their optional window argument. This
allows the user to easily bind actions to events without worrying
about passing around the window argument.

  However, it is unclear whether behind-the-scenes magic like this is
a good idea.  The merit of this approach is still under consideration;
it may be changed entirely. 
[From src/window.c:1063]


Window Style
-

  Window styles encapsulate the behaviour and appearance of windows.
They are applied to windows arbitrarily so different windows can
use different styles at the same time.  Numerous options are permitted
for window styles.  For some of the below options you will
need to use the appropriate module to make the options available. 
The options include at least:

Windows
-

  Windows are the most important scwm data type. A window object
represents an on-screen window that scwm is managing, and is used to
perform window management operations on the window, as well as to set
options and retrieve information about the window.
 
[From src/window.c:503]


X atoms
-

   X windows allows certain entities (for example, X properties [FIXME: XREF
to X properties]) to have arbitrary names. To avoid exchanging strings ever so
often, these names are in fact X atoms.

New X atoms can be created, or old ones retrieved simply by specifying
the string the atom stands for. An X atom can also be converted back to a
string. Scwm provides primitives for these actions. 
[From src/xproperty.c:360]


X Properties
-

   X has a notion of window properties, which live in the X
server. X window properties are often used to implement protocols
between applications and the window manager, which can have several
levels of standardization, from official X standard, to standardized
by some other organization, to made up informally by groups of
programmers, to specific to one window manager, to specific to an
individual, or installation.

  Scwm already internally implements many of these protocols,
including all X standard protocols, as well as the Motif and Open Look
protocols. However, the user should be able to implement any of these
he likes, including making up his own for personal use.

  This is possible through the low-level X property interface. Scwm has
one procedure to get, and set them, respectively.
