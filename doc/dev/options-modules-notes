OK, here is an idea that involves several changes.

1) Extract all the options stuff in some way such that it would be possible
for the GUI config module to know about the metainfo without necessarily
having the module loaded.

2) For each module, have some special option indicating wether that module
should be used at all.

3) If you have made settings for a module but you are not currently using it,
they are saved commented out in .scmw-options.

4) .scwm-options handles the use-modules for modules you said you want.

Greg notes:
Mention to Jim about the asymmetry re: unloading (or un-using) a module.
