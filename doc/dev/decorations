Random thoughts on a decoration rewrite, probably largely conflicting
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o All decoration styles currently possible should still be possible
o Simple styles should be simple to specify
  -  the decor vs. style distinction is confusing
o Accurate reproduction of looks&feels of other X WMs and non-X GUIs should
  be possible
  -  pixel-level positioning of buttons required?  or can this always be 
     simulated with appropriate pixmaps?  Consider the different spacing
     between the right three buttons in w95
  -  per-window settings/overrides need to be possible, even in a system where
     window schemes are shared - motif maximize button, for instance
  -  wm2/wmx-style doesn't fit at all in the fvwm2 modle; it should be
     allowed and generalized
o themes for other X WMs should be usable and/or simulatable
  -  best case, scheme-level support for parsing the configuration files



Sites of interest:
------------------
o http://www.themes.org/ and all the subsidiary sites, for examples of themes
  for other WMs; note that most of these fit fairly well into an fvwm-ish
  framework
o http://www.PLiG.org/xwinman/ for screenshots of various WMs;
  http://www.PLiG.org/xwinman/screenshots/wm2-default.gif in particular
  for a nice look/feel that doesn't fit the fvwm-ish framework at all.
  Not visible in this screenshot is the resize bar in the SE corner
  (maybe that is WMX only) - a small triangular piece that actually overlays
  the client window
o http://www.enlightenment.org/ - Enlightenment, a WM that is devoted to flash.
  We should be able to be just as flashy for users who want it, hopefully 
  straight from their config files, without giving up the substance.
