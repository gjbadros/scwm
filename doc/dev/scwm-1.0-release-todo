THINGS WE NEED TO DO FOR SCWM 1.0

These notes are compiled from a discussion between Maciej and Sam on
scwm-discuss, with some organizational and pseudo-executive decisions
made by me :-) --03/18/99 gjb


Web-page related
----------------

* Fix Scwm mailing list archive -- 1999 is not included

* Add a search engine to Scwm web (esp. for mailing list)
** glimpse based?

* Add a bug tracking facility to the web page
** which one?
** we need to enter the BUGS file into the database
** also, gjb has some marked messages from the mailing list that should
go in the bug database

DONE * Add a link to the auto-faq to the web page
** we need to enter Arturo Perez's list

* Add a projects list page

DONE * Mirror all the files needed to build a full-featured scwm
DONE ** Gtk-1.2, guile-gtk-0.15, cassowary-0.4

DONE * Mirror most dev tools needed
DONE ** autoconf, automake, libtool, jade rpm

DONE * Add links to developer's documentation

Installation related
--------------------
* confirm easy installation with guile, cassowary RPMs
** include pointers to those RPMs on Scwm web page

* Add "srpm", "rpm" and "deb" targets to the makefile to make it
easier to build source rpms, binary rpms, and debian packages


Scwm-core related
-----------------
* Update all copyrights to include 1999

* Have a really polished and useful system.scwmrc that showcases some of
the nicer features, but remains eminently usable. Each of the
sample.scwmrc-s  is better than the system.scwmrc.  

HACKED... * A bit of work to ensure destroying guile-gtk windows won't kill the
window manager.

* Further testing of session manager support

* Further testing of Gnome, KDE interoperability, especially ensuring
that the pagers work

DONE via imlib * Color limiting capability. Right now using scwm on an 8-bit display can eat a lot of images or lead to excessive color allocation failures.

DONE via imlib * Faster image loading. This, as well as the previous problem, could
probably be solved through an Imlib module (or even pervasive use of
Imlib).

DONE via ESD * Add sound support module

* Fix only the most awful API stupidity - a lot of the available
procedures have silly argument orders or are generally poorly
designed.  We shouldn't do a lot of this as it'll break stuff
internally and necessitate lots of testing, but if there are really dumb 
things we've done we should fix them now.

* GUI options/configuration (Making progress on this...)


Post-1.0 features
-----------------

* Improve gravity handling

* Move most useful stuff from flux.scm out to fully-supported modules

* event rewrite

* window groups feature (integration with constraints)

* improved API for constraint solver

* decoration rewrite

* rest of API cleanup

* first-class cursor objects

* Finish up the theme stuff (native theme mode at least, loading foreign
theme formats would require more generalization of our decoration code),
and have a few nice themes to distribute, either with scwm or
separately.

* Address some of the minor behavioral annoyances people experience
occasionally.

* More stuff moved into loadable modules.

* Maybe a bit more visual generalization and/or polish based on work
already done in fvwm2 since the fork (e.g. diagonal gradients, non-tiled
titlebar images, NeXT-looking menu style, snap attraction)
