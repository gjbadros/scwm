Building the RPMs is pretty trivial, but here's what I did:

1. cvs update
2. Blow away those annoying ltconfig & ltmain.sh files because they're
   a problem with my version of one of those equally annoying auto*
   tools.
3. ./autogen.sh
4. ./configure --enable-maintainer-mode
5. make
6. make disp

This gives scwm-0.9beta1.tar.gz, which I didn't want to package
because it wouldn't match what's on the web site, so I:

7. Unpacked scwm-0.9beta1.tar.gz
8. mv scwm-9.9beta1 scwm-19990117
9. tar czvf scwm-19990117.tar.gz scwm-19990117

This also wouldn't match the 1/17 snapshot, but I lucked out in that
such a snap isn't on the ftp server.

Next, the RPM packaging itself is just a matter of writing a spec
file.  I hacked up an old one to work with newer versions of rpm.

Once you've got the .spec file & the .tar.gz, you can build the source
& binary RPMs just by:

10. cp scwm.spec /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
11. cp scwm-19990117.tar.gz /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
12. rpm -ba /usr/src/redhat/SPECS

[[ At some point (now?), we should put the spec file inside the tar.gzs we
distribute, and then those three steps become just 'rpm -ta 
scwm-19990117.tar.gz'. -- Todd L. ]]

Once it finishes running you'll have:

   /usr/src/redhat/SRPMS/scwm-19990117-1hjs.src.rpm

and

   /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/scwm-19990117-1hjs.i386.rpm

(assuming you're building on intel).

If you install the src rpm, you get the tar.gz again in
/usr/src/redhat/SOURCES, and the scwm.spec in /usr/src/redhat/SPECS.

If you install the i386 rpm, you get scwm.

Note 1. The rpm build cmd (rpm -ba) doesn't just run make - it runs
configure first, so it should really build properly on other
systems...

Note 2. I set the release version to 1hjs to distinguish btw RPMs I
packaged and "official" ones.

Note 3. I listed huis-clos as the ftp source for the .tar.gz file
(which is in the source rpm), but it really isn't there because I made
the .tar.gz myself from my working cvs tree.

Note 4. If you want to package a newer snapshot, just change the
Version: line to the version # you want to use, and change the Source:
line if you want the source tar file is something other than
scwm-<version>.tar.gz.  Also change the Revision: (& take out my
initials).
