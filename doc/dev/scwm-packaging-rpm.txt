How to build RPMs of Scwm
-------------------------

If you want to build binary RPMs from the source RPMs, it should be as
simple as:
1. Get the source rpms, say foo.src.rpm
2. rpm --rebuild foo.src.rpm

Please report errors in this process.  More importantly, please report
successes and contribute your binary RPMs to our web site.

If you want to build RPMs from the CVS archive of the source, keep
reading.

Building the RPMs is pretty trivial, but here's what I did:

1. cvs update -dP
2. ./autogen.sh
3. ./configure --enable-maintainer-mode
4. make
5. make dist

This creates scwm-VERSION.tar.gz

Next, the RPM packaging itself is just a matter of using the scwm.spec
file from the top level directory.  Since the scwm.spec file is included
in the tar file, you can just do (as root):

rpm -ta scwm-VERSION.tar.gz

Once it finishes running you'll have:

   /usr/src/redhat/SRPMS/scwm-VERSION-RELEASE.src.rpm

and

   /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/scwm-VERSION-RELEASE.i386.rpm

(assuming you're building on intel).

If you install the src rpm, you get the tar.gz again in
/usr/src/redhat/SOURCES, and the scwm.spec in /usr/src/redhat/SPECS.

If you install the i386 rpm, you get scwm.

Note 1. The rpm build cmd (rpm -ba) doesn't just run make - it runs
configure first, so it should really build properly on other
systems...

Note 2. You should set the release version to include your initials
(e.g., 1hjs) to distinguish btw RPMs I packaged and "official" ones.
