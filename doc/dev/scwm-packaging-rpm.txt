How to build RPMs of Scwm
-------------------------

Building the RPMs is pretty trivial, but here's what I did:

1. cvs update -dP
2. ./autogen.sh
3. ./configure --enable-maintainer-mode
4. make
5. make dist

This creates scwm-VERSION.tar.gz

Next, the RPM packaging itself is just a matter of using the scwm.spec
file from the top level directory.  Since the scwm.spec file is included
in the tar file, you can just do (as root):

rpm -ta scwm-VERSION.tar.gz

Once it finishes running you'll have:

   /usr/src/redhat/SRPMS/scwm-VERSION-RELEASE.src.rpm

and

   /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/scwm-VERSION-RELEASE.i386.rpm

(assuming you're building on intel).

If you install the src rpm, you get the tar.gz again in
/usr/src/redhat/SOURCES, and the scwm.spec in /usr/src/redhat/SPECS.

If you install the i386 rpm, you get scwm.

Note 1. The rpm build cmd (rpm -ba) doesn't just run make - it runs
configure first, so it should really build properly on other
systems...

Note 2. You should set the release version to include your initials
(e.g., 1hjs) to distinguish btw RPMs I packaged and "official" ones.
