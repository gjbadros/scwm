This is somewhat off-topic on the list, but I'm mailing
it here because the audience of this message is window
manager authors; I'll pretend that it is relevant by
saying that if people agree with my suggestion it could
be added to the spec as "advice to implementors".


When opaque-resizing a window from the left, one frequently
sees "jumping" as center or right-aligned subwindows
are translated to the left and then repositioned into
place. X has a mechanism for controlling such behavior -
window gravity. By using either static gravity or
the appropriate gravity for an aligned element, this
artifact should be controllable.

However, the way most reparenting window managers implement
resizing defeats window gravity. Such window managers
first XMoveResizeWindow() the frame window into the right
place, and then XResizeWindow() the client window to 
the right size.

The correct behavior (in my opinion) is to set 
window gravity for the client window to StaticGravity,
then when a resize occurs. 

 - If the resize makes the window bigger:
   
   1) XMoveResizeWindow the client window to the new size and position
   2) XMoveResizeWindow the frame window to the new size and position

 - If the resize makes the window smaller:

   1) XMoveResizeWindow the frame window to the new size and position
   2) XMoveResizeWindow the client window to the new size and position

 - If the resize does opposite things in the two dimensions, 
   do one of the above sequences arbitrarily - you'll get a bit 
   of flashing around the border, as regions are temporarily exposed, 
   just as you would when doing things the "old-fashioned" way.

Do any window managers do this already? (I've seen the 
"incorrect" behavior with some versions of Fvwm, 
Enlightenment, and Sawmill, so it is pretty common.)

Hope this is useful,
                                        Owen

Little, but not nothing. It's a recommendation about
how a window manager should behave in order that its
clients can count on certain code (using window
gravity) working properly.

But I'd freely admit that the main reason I posted
here is the audience of window manager authors.

The ordering of resizes is rather incidental to my 
recommendation. The important part is using a MoveResize
on the client window instead of moving the frame window
and then reszing the client window.

That is, the appearance of the borders during opaque 
resizing depends on the resize sequence, and the best
sequence there probably depends on the exact geometry
of the frame windows and decorations, but using 
MoveResizeWindow and static gravity to move the client
window should be relatively universal.

(As an addition to what I said earlier, it's probably
good to only set win_gravity on the client window
during the resize operation and restore it afterwards
so if the window manager is killed it is less likely
to confuse other window managers that may not expect
this.)

                                        Owen
