Window manager resource usages. The binary size is the amount of disk
space used in bytes. The memory use is the runtime memory usage of the
window manager itself (and not any external modules that may or may
not get loaded) in kilobytes, with the default configuration. It is
probably the best representation of the actual amount of memory used,
and does not include the amount of shared library mappings that are in
its virtual memory space, which is listed in the shared column for
reference. Note that kwm, though it has a relatively small binary, is
a bit of a memory hog. Note also that none of the "ultra light-weight"
window managers here use significantly less memory than either version
of fvwm, and that it is a huge cost in functionality for that 200K or
300K saved out of 1M of memory usage. Finally, note that enlightenment
is probaly not a very good base for a wm that wants to be kind to
small machines. These stats (well, I didn't have them then, but my
intuitive thoughts along these lines) and the relative programmability
of each wm are the reason I chose fvwm 2.x as the base for my initial
work.

* These two binaries are so huge probably solely because they were not
stripped as installed.
