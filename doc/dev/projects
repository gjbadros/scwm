This file documents possible projects for contributors to Scwm. I've
split the projects up into categories so you can choose to volunteer for 
something that you are interested in and skilled with.

--09/18/99 Greg J. Badros

* Comprehensive (these are hard -- do not attack alone)
** decoration rewrite (see doc/dev/decorations)
** event rewrite (see doc/dev/events*)

* X11 hacking


* Scheme hacking


* Software-engineering 


* Configuration, building

** Rewrite configure.in from scratch, use macros directory like gnome projects
   (this would be *really* useful!)


* Testing 
** Write a scwm/scheme/primitive-tests/*.scm for each .c file that tests the primitives.
