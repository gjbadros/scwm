Notes about documentation, checking in:

o the first line of a doc string should be a brief synopsis sentence.  This
is in keeping with Emacs tradition, and the synopses are used in overviews
and treated slightly specially in places.

o be sure to mention all formal argument names in the doc string;  in
particular, running "rm -f scwm.sgml; make scwm.sgml" from doc/ will
verify that this has been done (tries to ensure reasonably complete 
documentation -- minimally users need to know what each formal is supposed
to contain... those descriptions usually come after the synopsis line).

o when you do check in, be sure to add a change log entry.  Emacs has
add-change-log-entry which works great if you use it from the file and
function in which you made the change.  If you're not using pcl-cvs mode 
to do your CVS updates, consider it -- it works pretty well, and is a
lot nicer than the command line or even the vc-mode keybindings.
