   This is the start of the scwm manual. It's not very complete or
accurate yet, but hopefully that will change.

   This documentation is pretty old. Look at the SGML documentation for
now until we can figure out a way to generate texi from DocBook.

Scheme Procedures
*****************

   The scwm configuration file is a Guile Scheme program. All of the
usual Guile procedures are available. In addition, the following
windowmanager-sepcific procedures have been implemented. See the sample
`system.scwmrc' file for examples. The fvwm2 man page may be helpful
for understanding some of the procedures or especially style options
until I write better documentation.

   Documentation style:

   A procedure documented as

 - Function: foo BAR BAZ #&OPTIONAL QUUX XYZZY . ARGS

   is called `foo' and has required arguments BAR and BAZ, optional
arguments QUUX and XYZZY, and accepts any variable number of arguments
beyond that. All the specifications follow this pattern.

FONTS
=====

 - Function: load-font FONTNAME
     This loads a font specified by the string FONTNAME and returns a
     font object. All proocedures which expect a font can take either a
     font object or a string specifier (in which case they
     automatically call load-font themselves) but it you want to use a
     font many times is more efficient to do something like:
          (define helvetica
            (load-font "-adobe-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"))

 - Function: font? OBJ
     Returns `#t' if OBJ is a font object, else `#f'.

 - Function: set-icon-font! FONT
 - Function: set-window-font! FONT
 - Function: set-menu-font! FONT
     These set the icon, titlebar and menu fonts respectively.

COLORS
======

 - Function: load-color COLORNAME
     `load-color' basically works like `load-font', except

 - Function: color? OBJ
     Returns `#t' if OBJ is a color object, else `#f'.

 - Function: set-hilight-colors! #&OPTIONAL FG BG
     Sets the hilight FOREGROUND and BACKGROUND colors. If you pass
     `#f' for either one, it is left unchanged.

 - Function: set-menu-colors! #&OPTIONAL FG BG STIPPLE
     This sets the menu FOREGROUND, BACKGROUND and STIPPLE colors.  As
     above, `#f' indicates that the relevant color should not be
     changed.

BINDINGS
========

 - Function: bind-key CONTEXTS KEY-SPECIFIER PROC
     This establishes a key binding. CONTEXTS specifies the context(s)
     in which it will be in effect.  It can be one of the following
     symbols or a list of several:

     `window', `title', `icon', `root', `frame', `sidebar', `button-1',
     `button-2', `button-3', `button-4', `button-5', `button-6',
     `button-7', `button-8', `button-9', `button-10', `all'

     Using `'all' as the context includes all of the others.

     The key to bind is specified as a string, sort of emacs-style. Some
     examples:

     `"x"', `"F1"', `"C-x"', `"M-space"', `"C-M-a"'

     Basically, you give a characer or a keysym prefixed by any
     combination of `"C-"', `"M-"' and `"S-"' representing Control, Meta
     and Shift respectively. Other prefixes that emacs understands will
     be implemented as soon as I understand what they do in emacs.

     The PROC is a Scheme procedure of no arguments. If the key binding
     = is invoked from within anywhere but the root window, the current
     window context is set to the window it was invoked from. Window
     contexts are explained in the section on window operations.

 - Function: unbind-key CONTEXTS KEY-SPECIFIER
     Removes the binding set for the specified KEY in the specified set
     of CONTEXTS.

 - Function: bind-mouse CONTEXTS BUTTON-SPECIFIER PROC
     Works much like `bind-key' above, but binds to a mouse action. In
     addition to possibly setting the WINDOW CONTEXT, it also sets the
     current mouse event type so that the type of mouse event can be
     distiguished from the procedure. This is explained in the section
     on `mouse-event-type' below.

     Mouse BUTTON SPECIFIERS are either numbers or strings that consist
     of a number with optional prefixes specifying modifier keys.
     mouse-<number> may be used as well. Here are some valid mouse
     specifiers:

     1 2 "M-1" "C-M-2" "mouse-3" "S-mouse-1"

 - Function: unbind-mouse CONTEXTS BUTTON-SPECIFIER
     Removes the binding set for the specified mouse event in the
     specified set of CONTEXTS.

 - Function: mouse-event-type
     If called from code that was invoked by a mouse binding, it
     returns the type of mouse event, one of `'motion' `'click'
     `'one-and-a-half-clicks' or `'double-click'. This can be used in
     conjunction with Scheme's `case' or `cond' special forms to do
     different things based on the type of event. This functionality may
     go away in favor of being able to bind any kind of mouse event type
     separately.

 - Function: bind-event EVENT PROC
     Binds a special windowmanager event to some special action.
     Currently defined events are:

    `'new-window'
          the procedure is called whenever a new window is created with
          no arguments and with the new window as the current window
          context. It is useful for specifying initial style options
          and parameters and such. It is not reccomended to use this
          event directly; instead, see the window-style procedure in
          the `(app scwm style)' module.

    `'new-window-hint'
          this event works much like `'new-window' except that the
          procedure is called much earlier in the window creation
          process. At this point most normal window procedures won't
          work. However, some, such as those that specify which
          position hints to obey and what type of placement to use must
          be used this early in the creation process so that the window
          can be put in the right place. This dichotomy is somewhat
          bogus and will probably be fixed later. If you access this
          functionality through the window-style procedure you
          shouldn't have to worry about this.

MISCELLANEOUS SETTINGS
======================

 - Function: set-menu-mwm-style! BOOL
     Determines if menus are MWM style or FVWM style.

 - Function: set-rubber-band-mask! INT
     Sets the XOR mask value used for rubber-banding windows.

 - Function: set-title-height! INT
     Sets the height of the title-bar.

 - Function: set-title-justify! SYM
     Sets the title-bar justification. The symbol must be one of
     `'left', `'right' or `'center'.

 - Function: set-click-time! INT
     Sets the maximum time that must elapse after a mouse can be
     pressed and not yet released that will still be interpreted as a
     click and not a motion. The time is given in milliseconds. The
     default is 150.

 - Function: set-colormap-focus! SYM
     Sets the colormap focus style, either `'focus' or `'mouse'. In the
     first case, the window with keyboard focus has the colormap focus,
     in the other case, the colormap focus follows the mouse even if the
     keyboard focus doesn't.

 - Function: set-opaque-move-size! INT
     Sets the largest window size that will be moved opaquely rather
     than with rubber-banding, as percentage of screen size. 0 will
     make all windows rubber-band when they move, while 100 will make
     all windows move as solid. The default

 - Function: set-smart-placement-is-really-smart! BOOL
 - Function: set-click-to-focus-passes-click! BOOL
 - Function: set-click-to-focus-raises! BOOL
 - Function: set-mouse-focus-click-raises! BOOL

 - Function: set-animation! VECTOR
     animation-ms-delay

MISCELLANEOUS OPERATIONS
========================

 - Function: refresh
     Refreshes the whole screen.

 - Function: pointer-position
     Returns a list of the current x and y coordinates of the mouse
     cursor.

 - Function: recapture

 - Function: restart NEW-WM

 - Function: wait-for-window PREDICATE

 - Function: beep
     My suggested definition in Scheme is not adequate for remote
     displays -- the new (tiny) C implementation using `XBell' should
     take care of = this.

SYNTHETIC EVENTS
================

 - Function: move-pointer-to X Y
     Moves the pointer to the absolute position X, Y.

 - Function: send-button-press BUTTON MODIFIER #&OPTIONAL WIN
          BUTTON_PRESS_P =
     button_release_p propagate_p

 - Function: send-key-press KEY #&OPTIONAL WIN BUTTON_PRESS_P
          BUTTON_RELEASE_P=
     propagate_p Send synthetic button and key presses.

WINDOWS
=======

 - Function: window? OBJ
     Returns `#t' if OBJ is a window object, else `#f'.

 - Function: get-window #&OPTIONAL USE_KILL_CURSOR USE_SELECT_WINDOW =
     WAIT_FOR_RELEASE Retrieves the current window context and returns
     the window object representing it. If no window context is set, it
     lets the user select a window by calling select-window. However,
     select-window is not really implemented yet so it will actually
     return `#f' in this case.

     The optional arguments are generally not needed in most user code.

 - Function: select-window USE_KILL_CURSOR WAIT_FOR_RELEASE
     Interactively selects a window.

     The optional arguments are generally not needed in most user code.

 - Function: current-window-with-focus
 - Function: current-window-with-pointer

WINDOW OPERATIONS
=================

   =46or all of these, the optional window argument defaults to the
current window context. This makes it convenient to bind window
operations to key or mouse events. It also means that in most cases,
you won't need to use the optional W argument, but sometimes it is
needed.

 - Function: focus #&OPTIONAL W
     Give W the keyboard focus.

 - Function: warp-to-window #&OPTIONAL W
     Warp the mouse pointer to the window W.

 - Function: delete-window #&OPTIONAL W
     Delete W, in other words, close it politely. This may not always
     work.

 - Function: destroy-window #&OPTIONAL W
     Destroy W, in other words, close it rudely. This always works, but
     will not give the application the chance to do special shutdown
     actions, like asking for confirmation.

 - Function: window-deletable? #&OPTIONAL W
     Returns `#t' if delete-window will work on W, else `#f'.

 - Function: lower-window #&OPTIONAL W
     Lowers W to the bottom of the window stack.

 - Function: raise-window #&OPTIONAL W
     Raises W to the top of the window stack.

 - Function: raised? #&OPTIONAL W
     Returns `#t' if W is currently raised, else `#f'.

 - Function: iconify #&OPTIONAL W
     Iconifies window W.

 - Function: deiconify #&OPTIONAL W
     Deiconifies window W.

 - Function: iconified? #&OPTIONAL W
     Determines if W is iconified.

 - Function: stick #&OPTIONAL W
     "Sticks" window `W'. This makes it remain in the same position on
     the screen when desks or pages are switched.

 - Function: unstick #&OPTIONAL W
     Reverses the effects of `stick'.

 - Function: sticky? #&OPTIONAL W
     Determines if a window is currently "sticky."

 - Function: window-shade #&OPTIONAL W ANIMATED_P
     Rolls up the window into just a title bar, like a window shade.
     Optionally animated.

 - Function: un-window-shade #&OPTIONAL W
     Reverses the effect of `window-shade'.

 - Function: window-shaded? #&OPTIONAL W
     Determines if the window is currently shaded.

 - Function: move-to X Y #&OPTIONAL W ANIMATED_P MOVE_POINTER_TOO_P
     Moves the window to X,Y on the current screen. The move can
     optionally be animated and it is possible to also move the pointer.

 - Function: interactive-move #&OPTIONAL W
     Begins an interactive move operation. The user can adjust the
     position of the window with the mouse or arrow keys.

 - Function: resize-to X Y #&OPTIONAL W
     Resizes the window to X by Y.

 - Function: interactive-resize #&OPTIONAL W
     Begins an interactive resize operation. The user can adjust the
     position of the window with the mosue or arrow keys.

 - Function: refresh-window #&OPTIONAL W
     Refreshes the window, ensuring that its contents and decorations
     are up to date and properly displayed.

 - Function: move-window-to-desk DESK #&OPTIONAL W
     Moves the window to a new desk, specified by an integer.

 - Function: keep-on-top #&OPTIONAL W
     Will raise the specified window and keep it on top of all other
     windows unless it is explicitly lowered.

 - Function: un-keep-on-top #&OPTIONAL W
     Negates the effects of `keep-on-top'.

 - Function: kept-on-top? #&OPTIONAL W
     Determines if a window is under the influence of `keep-on-top'.

WINDOW INFORMATION PROCEDURES
=============================

   These procedures return various kinds of information about windows.
They can be useful in selecting only particular windows

 - Function: window-position #&OPTIONAL W
 - Function: window-size #&OPTIONAL W
 - Function: window-id #&OPTIONAL W
 - Function: window-desk #&OPTIONAL W
 - Function: window-title #&OPTIONAL W
 - Function: window-class #&OPTIONAL W
 - Function: window-resource #&OPTIONAL W

 - Function: list-all-windows
     This returns a list of all of the windows currently being managed.

WINDOW STYLE OPERATIONS
=======================

   =46or most of these procedures, it is reccomended to access the
relevant functionality through the `window-style' or `style-one-window'
procedures rather than the given procedures. The working and arguments
can generally be deduced from the corresponding style option. Further

 - Function: show-titlebar #&OPTIONAL W
 - Function: hide-titlebar #&OPTIONAL W
 - Function: titlebar-shown? #&OPTIONAL W
 - Function: normal-border #&OPTIONAL W
 - Function: plain-border #&OPTIONAL W
 - Function: border-normal? #&OPTIONAL W
 - Function: set-border-width! WIDTH #&OPTIONAL W
 - Function: stick-icon #&OPTIONAL W
 - Function: unstick-icon #&OPTIONAL W
 - Function: icon-sticky? #&OPTIONAL W
 - Function: set-icon-box! X Y W H BOOL #&OPTIONAL W

 - Function: set-window-focus! SYM #&OPTIONAL W
     available are:
    `'click'
          must click on the window to focus.

    `'mouse'
          the window gains focus as the mouse enters or leaves.

    `'sloppy'
          the window gains focus as the mouse enters, but does not lose
          it if the pointer enters the root window, or a window with
          `'click' or `'none' focus.

    `'none'
          don't ever give this window focus, even if it is clicked.

 - Function: set-window-colors! #&OPTINAL FG BG W
 - Function: set-icon-title! STRING #&OPTIONAL W
 - Function: set-random-placement! BOOL #&OPTIONAL W
 - Function: set-smart-placement! BOOL #&OPTIONAL W
 - Function: set-window-button! NUM BOOL #&OPTIONAL W
 - Function: set-mwm-buttons! BOOL #&OPTIONAL W
 - Function: set-mwm-border! BOOL #&OPTIONAL W
 - Function: set-icon! BOOL-OR-STRING-OR-IMAGE #&OPTIONAL W
 - Function: set-mini-icon! BOOL-OR-STRING-OR-IMAGE #&OPTIONAL W

 - Function: set-hint-override! BOOL #&OPTIONAL W
 - Function: set-decorate-transient! BOOL #&OPTIONAL W
 - Function: set-mwm-decor-hint! BOOL #&OPTIONAL W
 - Function: set-mwm-func-hint! BOOL #&OPTIONAL W

 - Function: set-start-on-desk! DESK #&OPTIONAL W
 - Function: set-skip-mapping! BOOL #&OPTIONAL W
 - Function: set-lenience! BOOL #&OPTIONAL W

MENUS
=====

 - Function: menu? OBJ
     Returns `#t' if OBJ is a menu object, else `#f'.

 - Function: make-menu TITLE [(LIST NAME
          PROC-OR-MENU)|`'title'|`'separator'] ...
     Creates a menu object.  The first argument is a string that is the
     menu title, however, the title is not necessarily displayed unless
     so specified.  Arguments are successively one of `'title',
     `'separator', or a list of a string and a either procedure of no
     arguments or another menu object.  Respectively, these result in a
     title, a separator bar, or an entry that will call the procedure
     when selected, or display the menu as a submenu.  It is
     reccomended that an actual menu object be specified for submenus
     rather than a procedure which uses popup to display the menu,
     because

 - Function: popup MENU #&OPTIONAL STICK?
     Pops up the menu. If STICK is specified, it determines if the menu
     stays up when the mouse is released, assuming it was started in
     response to a mouse click. The default is `#f'.

IMAGES
======

 - Function: make-image NAME
     Creates a Scheme image object loaded from the first file found in
     the image path that matches NAME.

 - Function: set-image-path! PATH
     Paths are specified as strings that contain a colon-delimited list
     of directories.  This will change, as they obviously should be
     lists, preferably in an ordinary scheme variable.

VIRTUAL DESKTOP
===============

 - Function: set-current-desk! DESK
 - Function: set-viewport-position! X Y
 - Function: set-edge-scroll! X Y
 - Function: set-edge-wrap! X Y
 - Function: set-edge-resistance! SCROLL-RESISTANCE MOVE-RESISTANCE
 - Function: set-desk-size! X Y
 - Function: display-size
 - Function: desk-size
 - Function: viewport-position
 - Function: current-desk

DECORS
======

 - Function: make-decor #&OPTIONAL NAME
 - Function: default-decor
 - Function: set-current-decor! DECOR
 - Function: current-decor
 - Function: set-window-decor! DECOR #&OPTIONAL WINDOW

FACES
=====

 - Function: make-face FLAGS SPECS
 - Function: set-title-face! ACTIVE_UP_FACE #&OPTIONAL ACTIVE_DOWN_FACE
          =
     INACTIVE_FACE

 - Function: set-button-face! NUM ACTIVE_UP_FACE #&OPTIONAL
          ACTIVE_DOWN_FACE =
     INACTIVE_FACE

 - Function: set-button-mwm-flag! NUM BOOLEAN
 - Function: set-border-face! ACTIVE_FACE #&OPTIONAL INACTIVE_FACE

PROCEDURES IN SCHEME
====================

   These procedures are written and scheme and are there to provide a
friendlier interface to the builtins.

   These two are always available because they are defined in the
default rc code that's built into the binary. They do not accept an
optional window argument since they are meant to be used with mouse or
key bindings and depend on the mouse event type.

 - Function: resize-or-raise
     Always raise the window, resize it interactively if the mouse is
     moved, and lower on a double-click.

 - Function: move-or-raise
     Always raise the window, move it interactively if the mouse is
     moved, and lower on a double-click.

Modules
*******

   The rest of the operations are available in modules. Each set is
prefaced with the proper module name.

MODULE (app scwm base)
======================

 - Function: %x X
     X is treated as a precentage of the horizontal screen size and the
     proper value in pixels is returned. This is useful for writing `rc'
     files that don't depend too much on the display size for reasonable
     placement.

 - Function: %y Y
     Just like `%x', but for the vertical direction.

 - Function: x- X
 - Function: y- Y
 - Function: %x- X
 - Function: %y- Y

 - Function: w%x X #&OPTIONAL W
 - Function: w%y Y #&OPTIONAL W
     These work like `%x' and `%y' but give a percentage of the
     dimensions of the given window.

 - Function: execute COMMAND
     Executes a shell `command' as a separate process, for example
     `(execute "xterm")' or `(execute "cat ~/some-file | grep
     pattern")' or whatever.

 - Function: set-menu-foreground! FG
 - Function: set-menu-background! BG
 - Function: set-menu-stipple! ST
     These set only one of the menu color components. They may go away
     since the `menu-style' interface is more useful.

 - Function: set-window-foreground! FG #&OPTIONAL W

 - Function: set-window-background! BG #&OPTIONAL W

 - Function: move-pointer X Y
     Moves the mouse pointer relative to the current position
     (`move-pointer-to' moves it absolutely).

 - Function: move-viewport X Y
     Moves the viewport relatively (`set-viewport-position!' does it
     absolutely)

 - Function: menu-style #&KEY FG FOREGROUND BG BACKGROUND STIPPLE FONT
          MWM =
     mwm-style This is a general-purpose interface for setting various
     things that relate to menus. It is called with keyword-value pairs
     like so:
          (menu-style #:fg "red" #:background "black" #:mwm #t)

     This example sets the foreground to red, the background to black,
     and the mwm-style to true. The keywords available are:
    `#:foreground'
    `#:fg'
          foreground color

    `#:background'
    `#:bg'
          background color

    `#:stipple'
          stipple color

    `#:font'
          font

    `#:mwm-style'
    `#:mwm'
          mwm style. If true, menus are "mwm style", else they are
          "fvwm = style".

 - Function: simple-title-style #&KEY FONT HEIGHT JUSTIFY
     This is a similar interface to the above. The available keywords
     are

    `#:font'
          the titlebar font

    `#:height'
          the titlebar height

    `#:justify'
          the justification - `'left', `'right' or `'center'.

MODULE (app scwm winops)
========================

   This is a collection of extra window operations. Like the standard
window operations, they default to the current window context if the
window is not specified.

 - Function: make-toggling-winop PRED NEG POS
     This can be used to define toggling window operations easily. you
     pass a PREDICATE which determines if the window has been affected,
     then a PROCEDURE which undoes the operation, then one which does
     it, and a procedure is returned which will do a toggling version
     of the effect.

 - Function: close-window #&OPTIONAL W
     Delete the window if possible, otherwise destroy it.

 - Function: toggle-raise #&OPTIONAL W
     Raise the window if it is not already on top. If it is, lower it.

 - Function: toggle-iconify #&OPTIONAL W
     Iconify the window if it isn't already, else deiconify it.

 - Function: toggle-stick #&OPTIONAL W
     Stick the window if it isn't already, else unstick it.

 - Function: toggle-window-shade #&OPTIONAL W
     window-shade the window if it isn't already, else un-window-shade
     it.

 - Function: maximize NW NH #&OPTIONAL W
     Maximizes the window to size nw by nh. If either of nw or nh is 0,
     the size in that direction will not be changed. Also, a window
     maximized vertically will be moved to the top edge of the display,
     and a window maximized horizontally will be moved to the left edge.

 - Function: maximized? #&OPTIONAL W
     Determines if the window is maximized.

 - Function: unmaximize #&OPTIONAL W
     Unmaximizes the window if it is maximized, restoring it to its size
     and position previous to any maximize operations.

 - Function: toggle-maximize NW NH #&OPTIONAL W
     A toggling version of maximize.

 - Function: print-window #&OPTIONAL W
     Prints a screen dump of the selected window.

 - Function: menu-title
 - Function: menu-separator
 - Function: menu-item MENU-ITEM NAME #&KEY ABOVE-PIXMAP LEFT-PIXMAP
          ACTION

MODULE (app scwm winlist)
=========================

   This module includes procedures for manipulating the window list.

 - Function: default-winlist-proc #&OPTIONAL W
     This is the normal default window list procedure. It deiconifies,
     focuses and raises the window, then warps the pointer to a
     convenient point inside it.

 - Variable: window-list-proc
     This varibale holds the procedure that will be applied by default
     to the window selected from the window list menu.  It is normally
     `default-winlist-proc', but you can `set!' it to something else to
     make that the default behavior.

 - Function: list-windows #&KEY ONLY EXCEPT
     This works like `list-all-windows' but allows you to specify
     additional conditions on the windows returned. The `#:only' and
     `#:except' keyword parameters may be specified to achieve this.
     Either should be followed by a predicate or list of predicates.
     The windows returned are those that satisfy all of the `#:only'
     predicates but none of the `#:except' predicates.

 - Function: winlist-skip
 - Function: winlist-hit
 - Function: winlist-skip?

 - Function: show-window-list-menu #&KEY ONLY EXCEPT PROC SHOW-GEOMETRY
     This procedure shows a menu that lists the title of every suitable
     window, and takes an action on the appropriate window if one is
     selected. Here is the meaning of the keywords:

    `#:only'
          as above with `list-windows'; show only those windows that
          satisfy the predicate or predictes given.

    `#:except'
          as above with `list-windows'; show only those windows that do
          not satisfy the predicate or predictes given.

    `#:proc'
          apply this procedure to the window selected to the menu.
          defaults to `window-list-proc'.

    `#:show-geometry'
          If `#t', will show the window geometry in addition to titles.
          Defaults to `#f'.

     These procedures do something useful to the next or previous
     window in the window list. They are most useful for implementing
     circulation of the window list with the keyboard. Here is the
     meaning of the keywords:

    `#:window'
          start going forward or back in the window list from the
          specified window; defaults to the current window context.

    `#:only'
          as above with `list-windows'; show only those windows that
          satisfy the predicate or predictes given.

    `#:except'
          as above with `list-windows'; show only those windows that do
          not satisfy the predicate or predictes given.

    `#:proc'
          apply this procedure to the window selected to the menu.
          defaults to `window-list-proc'.

   This module also adds these style options:

`#:winlist-skip'
     skip this window in the window list menu

`#:circulate-skip'
     #t/#f, skip this window when circulating with `next-window' or
     `prev-window', or not.

`#:circulate-skip-icon'
     `#t'/`#f', skip this window when circulating with = `next-window'
     or `prev-window', or not.

MODULE (app scwm wininfo)
=========================

   This module provides additional predicates and generally informative
procedures for finding out stuff about windows.

 - Function: on-desk? N #&OPTIONAL W
 - Function: on-desk-n? N
 - Function: on-current-desk? #&OPTIONAL W
 - Function: in-viewport-any-desk? #&OPTIONAL W
 - Function: visible? #&OPTIONAL W

 - Function: geometry-string #&OPTIONAL W

 - Function: wildcard-matcher WILDCARD #&KEY FULL-REGEXP REGEXP-OPRIONS
     Returns a procedure that takes one optional window argument (which
     defaults to the current window context) and which will determine

 - Function: wildcard-match? WILDCARD #&OPTIONAL W

MODULE (app scwm optargs)
=========================

   This module provides the interface for optional and keyword arguments
used by the other modules. It does not rely on any scwm-specific
functionality and can be used by any Guile script - in theory. I do not
reccomend using it in random programs because Guile will probably have
its own interface for optional and keyword arguments to Scheme
procedures some day. For this reason, the only complete documentation
is in the file optargs.scm itself. If you really want procedures with
optional or keyword arguments, take a look at some of the scheme
modules to see how it's done.

MODULE (app scwm style)
=======================

   Styles let you specify how the look and feel of given windows starts
out. Most of the styles (those dealing with initial placement and
windowmanager hints) can also be set with interactive procedures. In
some cases,

 - Function: make-style . ARGS
     This creates a style that can be used with the `#:use-style' option
     of the style commands. It's really just a cons cell but it's poor
     to depend on that. The arguments can be any of the options
     accepted by the `window-style' command (see below).

 - Function: style-one-window W . ARGS
     This applies a style to a single window. The arguments can be any
     of the options accepted by the `window-style' command (see below).

 - Function: window-style CONDITION . ARGS
     This establishes a style that is applied to current and future
     windows, much like the fvwm Style command. CONDITION can be a
     predicate that takes a window as an argument in which case all
     current and future windows that satisfy the predicate will be
     styled; a string, in which case all present and future windows
     that wildcard-match the string (see `wildcard-match' above) will
     be styled; or `#t', in which case all future and present windows
     will be matched.  Of course, `"*"' has the same effect as `#t',
     and is even special-cased to be equally efficient, so the choice
     between these is a matter of style. The remaining args are
     keywords alternating with values.  The available keywords can be
     extended by the user, but many standard ones are defined. Styles
     defined by `window-style' are applied to new windows in the order
     in which they are defined.  Also, unlike most procedures that take
     keyword options, the same key may be specified more than once.
     The keys are processed in order, so the last one of a conflicting
     pair is the one that will take effect.

 - Function: add-window-style-option KEY HANDLER
 - Function: add-boolean-style-option KEY T-HANDLER F-HANDLER
 - Function: add-window-hint-option KEY HANDLER
 - Function: add-boolean-hint-option KEY T-HANDLER F-HANDLER
     These procedures let you define your own style options. The
     following style options are predefined:

    `#:border-width'
          the number given will be used as the width of the window's
          border -- a small or 0 border-width, possible combined with
          `#:no-titlebar' or `#:plain-border' can make "utility"
          windows that you don't want to move around or resize very
          much relatively unobtrusive.

    `#:background'
          specify a color or string

    `#:bg'
          synonym for `#:background'

    `#:foreground'
          specify a color or string that will be used as the forground
          color of windows using this style.

    `#:fg'
          synonym for `#:foreground'

    `#:focus'
          sets the window's focus style, `'click', `'mouse', `'sloppy'
          or `'none'.

    `#:plain-border'
          if `#t', makes the window have a plain border with no resize
          handles in the corner -- like NoHandles

    `#:icon-title'
          sets the title of the window's icon to the specified string.

    `#:icon-box'
          a list of four numbers represents the x, y, width and height
          parameters of the icon box used for this window.

    `#:sticky-icon'
          `#t'/`#f' makes the window's icon (only) sticky or not.

    `#:start-iconified'
          `#t'/`#f', makes the window start iconified or not.

    `#:kept-on-top'
          if `#t', makes the window start as if keep-on-top had been
          called on it, in other words, it stays on top,

    `#:sticky'
          `#t' or `#f', determines if the window starts sticky or not.

    `#:no-titlebar'
          `#t'/`#f', makes the window lack or have a titlebar
          respectively.

    `#:mwm-buttons'
          use mwm buttons -- particular buttons should have their
          beveling inverted when the window is maximized. This does not
          currently work.

    `#:mwm-border'
          `#t' or `#f', determines if the border is mwm style or not.
          An mwm-style border has shallower insets than a normal one.

    `#:icon'
          `#t', `#f' or a string that specifies an icon.  If `#f', the
          window will have no icon.  If `#t', it will have one, but what
          it will be is unspecified. If a string, the bitmap or pixmap
          specified will be used as the icon.

    `#:mini-icon'
          `#t' or `#f' or a string that specifies a mini-icon. As above.

    `#:random-placement'
          if `#t', windows with this style will always be placed
          non-interactively, otherwise they will be sometimes placed
          interactively if the placement algorithms fail.

    `#:smart-placement'
          if `#t', windows with this style will be placed in an empty
          place on the screen if they'd require user interaction to
          place, if no such place is found they are placed according to
          the value of smart-placement.

    `#:button'
          specifies that the button identified by the given number will
          be drawn for the window. Currently doesn't really work very
          well.

    `#:no-button'
          specifies that the button identified by the given number will
          not be drawn for the window. Currently doesn't really work
          very well.

    `#:hint-override'
          if mwm-function hints are used, this

    `#:decorate-transient'
          `#t' or `#f', decorate transient windows or not.

    `#:mwm-decor-hint'
          `#t' or `#f', follow mwm decoration hints or not.

    `#:mwm-func-hint'
          `#t' or `#f', follow mwm function hints or not.

    `#:PPosition-hint'
          `#t'/`#f', use the PPosition hint or not.

    `#:OL-decor-hint'
          `#t'/`#f', use the OpenLook window manager hints or not.

    `#:start-on-desk'
          makes the window start on the specified desk. If `#f', it can
          start on any desk.

    `#:skip-mapping'
          `#t' or `#f', change to the windows's desk while it is mapping
          or not.

    `#:lenience'
          `#t' or `#f'; if `#t', ignore window manager hints that say
          the window should never get the input focus, otherwise obey
          them.

    `#:use-style'
          use a style created with make-style.

     Here are some extra style options not available in fvwm:

    `#:start-maximized'
          takes `#f' or a list of two numbers. In the former case, the
          window does not start maximized, in the latter case it is
          maximized horizontally and/or vertically as specified by the
          numbers.

    `#:start-lowered'
          `#t' or `#f' -- sick of your windows starting on top of
          everything? Make them start out lowered with this handy
          option.

    `#:start-window-shaded'
          `#t' or `#f', make the window start window-shaded (as per
          window-shade) or not.

    `#:other-proc'
          lets you specify an additional procedure to apply to the
          window after it is created.

    `#:other-hint-proc'
          lets you specify an additional procedure to apply to the
          window when hints are being processed.
