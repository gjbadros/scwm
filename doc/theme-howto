Directory themes:

Suppose you want to create a theme called `fantabulous'. The following
steps are necessary:

* Create a `fantabulous' directory.

* Copy all the images to be used by the theme into the directory.

* Create a file theme.scm in the directory.

* The file should define a Guile module named (app scwm theme
fantabulous), which should import at least the (app scwm theme-impl)
module, for example like this:

(define-module (app scwm theme fantabulous)
  :use-modules (app scwm theme-impl)
  :use-modules (app scwm style))


* The file should export a variable named `the-theme' which should be
bound to the appropriate theme object created with make-theme.

For example:

(define-public the-theme 
  (make-theme "fantabulous" #:window-style
	      (make-style #:border-width 20)))

* Whenever loading images in the theme, use `load-theme-image', not
just a bare filename. This will properly load images from the theme directory.


.tar and .tar.gz themes:

* Just tar up the directory structure of a directory theme, and name
it something appropriate with the same filename stem. For instance, if
you have a directory `foo' that contains a theme, the command `tar
cvf foo.tar foo' run in the same directory as foo will create an
appropriate tar theme. The result can then be gzipped.



See the themes directory in the scwm distribution for a few examples.
