Primary Authors of Scwm
=======================

Greg J. Badros, gjb@cs.washington.edu:
Maciej Stachowiak, mstachow@alum.mit.edu:

Greg and Maciej have worked together on Scwm since Maciej first
converted fvwm2 to use Guile/Scheme as its configuration language in
September of 1997.  Together, they've written, debugged, maintained,
and packaged Scwm over the last two years.  But they could not have done 
it without the support of many, many other folks!



Especially Substantial Contributors To Scwm
===========================================

Sam Steingold:

provided numerous bug fixes, added several useful Scheme modules, and
wrote an emacs interaction mode for Scwm. Wrote the following files
in the directory scheme:
    std-menus.scm wmconfig-menu.scm prefs-menu.scm doc.scm flux.scm

and in the directory utilities/emacs:
    scwm.el



Robert Bihlmeyer:

added some bits here, and there. Notable changes include support for
session management, ICCCM-compliant modifier handling, querying xlock
about available modes, readline-support in scwmrepl, and exposing
X-properties to scheme. Takes responsibility for the following files
in the directory scwm:

    session-manager.c  xproperty.c

in the scheme directory:
    advice.scm


Todd Larason, jtl@molehill.org:

fiddled here and there, moving bugs from one place to another.  Finished
Greg's work on pluggable menu looks, and added support for dynamically
loaded modules.  added a few other smaller bits.  Is responsible for the 
current shape the following files in the directory scwm:

   menu.c drawmenu.c 

Is the primary author of the following file in the directory scwm:
   menulook.c

Is responsible for the current menu interface in base.scm.

Primary author of the following files under the modules directory:
   pie-menus/draw-pie-menu.c xpm-menus/draw-xpm-menu.c



Jeff Nichols, jwnichls@cs.washington.edu>:

much of the work on the constraints user interface was written by
Jeff. Is largely responsible (with Greg, mostly) for scheme/:

   message-window.scm nonants.scm
   ui-constraints-buttons.scm ui-constraints-classes.scm
   ui-constraints-composition.scm
   ui-constraints-gdk-drawing.scm
   ui-constraints-gtk-toggle-menu.scm



Legacy Authors of Code from which Scwm originally derived
=========================================================

Tom LaStrange: 

wrote Twm, from which Scwm is indirectly derived. The following files
in the subdirectory scwm still supposedly have traces of twm code:

    add_window.c events.c



Robert Nation:

originally wrote Fvwm, from which Scwm is derived. The
following files in the subdirectory scwm bear his copyright, and thus
presumably include at least some portions of his code, in the
subdirectory scwm:

    binding.c     borders.c     color.c       colormaps.c
    colors.c      complex.c     decor.c       deskpage.c  
    decorations.c events.c      face.c        focus.c
    icons.c       misc.c        miscprocs.c   move.c
    placement.c   resize.c      scwm.c        util.c
    window.c


Charles Hines:

continued maintenance of Fvwm after the retirement of Robert Nation as
maintainer.  Many other people added code at this point, but
determining exactly who did what is difficult due to lack of accurate
records.
