Authors of Scwm
===============

Maciej Stachowiak, mstachow@mit.edu:
originally modified fvwm to use guile as the configuration language,
yielding scwm. Many changes throughout, and wrote the following files
in the subdirectory scwm (or mostly wrote the latest versions):
    callbacks.c color.c decor.c deskpage.c 
    errors.c    face.c  font.c  miscprocs.c 
    scmprocs.c  scmtypes.c image.c shutdown.c
in the subdirectory scheme:
    auto-raise.scm  base.scm          bincomm.scm     decor.scm 
    fvwm-compat.scm fvwm-eval.scm     fvwm-module.scm image-loaders.scm
    optargs.scm     style-options.scm style.scm       wininfo.scm
    winlist.scm     winops.scm        animation.scm   cascade.scm 
    file.scm        listops.scm       shutdown-opts.scm stacking.scm 
    theme-impl.scm  themes.scm
in the subdirectory utilities/libscwmexec:
    libmain.c  scwmexec.h
in the subdirectory utilities/scwmexec:
    scwmexec.c
in the subdirectory utilities/scwmrepl:
    scwmrepl.c
in the subdirectory modules/background:
    background.c

Greg J. Badros, gjb@cs.washington.edu:

added numerous improvements, including integrating his constraint
solving toolkit, synthetic event support, improved menu support,
animated moves and windowshades, and many, many other features. Also
wrote code that evolved into and/or inspired the scwmexec program and
the fvwm module support. Greg started working on scwm only weeks after
Maciej began the rewrite and has been involved throughout the project.
Greg designed the in-source markup system and developed the initial perl
version of the documentation extraction system. He has implemented many
software engineering improvements throughout the system, and is the
primary author or maintainer of at least the following files, in the
directory scwm:
    Grab.c      ICCCM.c            draw-pie-menu.c drawmenu.c 
    menuitem.c  module-interface.c scwmenu.c       string_token.c 
    system.c    xrm.c              xmisc.c         miscprocs.c
    log-usage.c
in the directory scheme:
    flux.scm minimal.scm module-types.scm xlock-menu.scm sort.scm
    cached-program-exists.scm
in the directory utilities/dev:
    X-error-describe.in convert-file-to-c-string-variable
    convert-dependency-dot-graph.in
    scwm-usage-counter.in
in the directory modules/c-animation:
    c-animation.c
in the directory modules/overlay-plane:
    get_color.c overlay-plane.c


Sam Steingold:
provided numerous bug fixes, added several useful Scheme modules, and
wrote an emacs interaction mode for scwm. Wrote the following files
in the directory scheme:
    std-menus.scm wmconfig-menu.scm prefs-menu.scm doc.scm flux.scm

and in the directory utilities/emacs:
    scwm.el


Robert Bihlmeyer:
added some bits here, and there. Notable changes include
ICCCM-compliant modifier handling, querying xlock about available
modes, readline-support in scwmrepl, and exposing X-properties to
scheme. Is to blame for the following files in the directory scwm:
    xproperty.c


Todd Larason, jtl@molehill.org:
fiddled here and there, moving bugs from one place to another.  Finished
Greg's work on pluggable menu looks, and added support for dynamically
loaded modules.  added a few other smaller bits.  Is responsible for the 
current shape the following files in the directory scwm:
   menu.c drawmenu.c 
Is the primary author of the following file in the directory scwm:
   menulook.c
Is responsible for the current menu interface in base.scm
Primary author of the following files under the modules directory:
   pie-menus/draw-pie-menu.c xpm-menus/draw-xpm-menu.c


Tom LaStrange: 
wrote Twm, from which Scwm is indirectly derived. The following files
in the subdirectory scwm still supposedly have traces of twm code:
    add_window.c events.c


Robert Nation:
originally wrote Fvwm, from which Scwm is (currently) derived. The
following files in the subdirectory scwm bear his copyright, and thus
presumably include at least some portions of his code, in the
subdirectory scwm:
    binding.c     borders.c     color.c       colormaps.c
    colors.c      complex.c     decor.c       deskpage.c  
    decorations.c events.c      face.c        focus.c
    icons.c       misc.c        miscprocs.c   move.c
    placement.c   resize.c      scwm.c        util.c
    window.c


Charles Hines:
continued maintenance of Fvwm after the retirement of Robert Nation as
maintainer. Many other people added code at this point, but
determining exactly who did what is difficult due to lack of accurate
records.
