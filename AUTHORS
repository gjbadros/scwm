Maciej Stachowiak:
originally modified fvwm to use guile as the configuration language,
yielding scwm. Many changes throughout, and wrote the following files
in the subdirectory scwm:
    callbacks.c color.c decor.c deskpage.c 
    errors.c    face.c  font.c  miscprocs.c 
    scmprocs.c  scmtypes.c
in the subdirectory scheme:
    auto-raise.scm  base.scm          bincomm.scm     decor.scm 
    fvwm-compat.scm fvwm-eval.scm     fvwm-module.scm image-loaders.scm
    optargs.scm     style-options.scm style.scm       wininfo.scm
    winlist.scm     winops.scm 
in the subdirectory utilities/libscwmexec:
    libmain.c  scwmexec.h
in the subdirectory utilities/scwmexec:
    scwmexec.c
in the subdirectory utilities/scwmrepl:
    scwmrepl.c


Greg J. Badros:

added numerous improvements, including integrating his constraint
solving toolkit, synthetic event support, improved menu support,
animated moves and windowshades, and many, many other features. Also
wrote code that evolved into and/or inspired the scwmexec program and
the fvwm module support. Greg started working on scwm only weeks after
Maciej began the rewrite and has been involved throughout the project.
He is the primary author or maintainer of at least the following files,
in the directory scwm:
    Grab.c      ICCCM.c            draw-pie-menu.c drawmenu.c 
    menuitem.c  module-interface.c scwmenu.c       string_token.c 
    system.c    xrm.c xmisc.c
in the directory scheme:
    flux.scm minimal.scm module-types.scm xlock-menu.scm
in the directory utilities/dev:
    X-error-describe


Sam Steingold:
provided numerous bug fixes, added several useful Scheme modules, and
wrote an emacs interaction mode for scwm. Wrote the following files
in the directory scheme:
    std-menus.scm wmconfig-menu.scm prefs-menu.scm doc.scm flux.scm

and in the directory utilities/emacs:
    scwm.el


Robert Bihlmeyer:
added some bits here, and there. Notable changes include
ICCCM-compliant modifier handling, querying xlock about available
modes, readline-support in scwmrepl, and exposing X-properties to
scheme. Is to blame for the following files in the directory scwm:
    xproperty.c



Tom LaStrange: 
wrote Twm, from which Scwm is indirectly derived. The following files
in the subdirectory scwm still supposedly have traces of twm code:
    add_window.c events.c

Robert Nation:
originally wrote Fvwm, from which Scwm is (currently) derived. The
following files in the subdirectory scwm bear his copyright, and thus
presumably include at least some portions of his code, in the
subdirectory scwm:
    binding.c     borders.c     color.c       colormaps.c
    colors.c      complex.c     decor.c       deskpage.c  
    decorations.c events.c      face.c        focus.c
    icons.c       misc,c        miscprocs.c   move.c
    placement.c   resize.c      scwm.c        util.c
    window.c

Charles Hines:
continued maintenance of Fvwm after the retirement of Robert Nation as
maintainer. Many other people added code at this point, but
determining exactly who did what is difficult due to lack of accurate
records.
