In approximate order of priority:

- Better error handling 
  - get a line number!
  - Don't crash and burn so often
  - keep trying on .scwmrc especially!
  - more consistent use, especially abstractions for argument type checking

- Respond to scwmsend-s via some reasonable iccm

- Use guile-snarf pervasively

- Add a hook to the scwm_error handler routine passing the request error and event type; provide a module to make these human readable -- see X-error-describe

- color scheme wrappers need reference counting; whole rewrite like image?

- replace ColorPair struct w/ scheme-object based

- replace MyFont struct w/ scheme-object based -- font scheme wrappers
still use the MyFont garbage; clean this up

- Clean out all of the artifacts of the FVWM function system.

- scwm.h has some stuff that belongs in window.h; separate these out better

- add_window.c, borders.c seem to duplicate some functionality
  - figure out what each should do and remove extraneous stuff
  - modularize the window decorations as C functions

- figure out dynamic loading issues
  - what is guile's support for this?
  - test with the drawmenu.c functions
    -- menu objects should be able to specify a .o file containing
       the functions they want to use to do the drawing

- Write some graphical reconfiguration tools.

- Interactive move/resize should permit using a real color, not just
an xor-value, as an option

- Opaque resize -- afterstep and others do this

- Rename scwm/scwm directory to scwm/src

- Quote key feature -- like C-q in Emacs, C-v in shells

- Eventually, a total rewrite will probably be needed to allow release
under GPL and reorganize years of layered cruft.

- Undo feature?

Done:

- Finish implementing (useful) Fvwm functions as Scheme procedures. 
[this is mostly the style, decor, desk and path stuff,
modules should be punted.]

- Make scwm work with autoconf.

- Synthetic mouse presses

- Synthetic key presses

- Animated window shades --gjb 11/9/97
