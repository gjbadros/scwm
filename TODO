In approximate order of priority:

- Finish implementing (useful) Fvwm functions as Scheme procedures. 
[this is mostly the style, decor, desk and path stuff,
modules should be punted.]

- Clean out all of the artifacts of the FVWM function system.

- Write the graphical reconfiguration tools.

- Change the guts to use LISPier data structures when possible, to
ease integration with the scheme procedures.

- Eventually, a total rewrite will probably be needed to allow release
under GPL and reorganize years of layered cruft.

- Steal nice features from other window managers. Put them in modules where
possible, to have a featureful yet lean wm.

- Interactive move/resize should permit using a real color, not just
an xor-value, as an option

- Opaque resize

- Quote key feature -- like C-q in Emacs, C-v in shells

- Animated window shades (afterstep does this; patch for fvwm to do it too)

- Modular window decoration system.

Done:

- Make scwm work with autoconf.
