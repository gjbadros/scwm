1999-12-17 16:31:05  Shenghuo ZHU  <zsh@cs.rochester.edu>

	* decor.c (s_set_window_decor_x): Use decor reference.
	* add_window.c (AddWindow): Ditto.
	* add_window.c (DestroyScwmWindow): Set Scr.Hilite.

Tue Dec  7 16:26:37 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* events.c (s_handle_pending_events): Do not dispatch events when
	still capturing the windows.  Avoids possible deadlocks.

Tue Dec  7 16:18:00 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* callbacks.c (scwm_safe_call1): Only warn when using
	call-interactively to invoke *named* procedures that do not have
	interactive specifications.

	* placement.c (PlaceWindow): Do not use a placement procedure when 
	doing the initial capture of windows.  Avoids a deadlock.

Tue Dec  7 14:56:20 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* callbacks.c: Fix arg mismatch caught by scwmdoc.

Tue Dec  7 11:16:48 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* events.c: Use FRAME_[XY]_VP(psw) in getting arguments for
	x_motionnotify_hook instead of using psw->frame_x.  This makes
	nonant-selection work even when not at the (0,0) viewport.

Tue Dec  7 08:27:51 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* events.c: pass 2nd arg to call_interactively.

	* callbacks.h, callbacks.c: Added 2nd arg (debug) to call-interactively.

Sun Dec  5 17:31:48 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* add_window.c, events.c, image.c: Fix some unescaped quotes in
 	SCWM_HOOK macro docstrings.

Sun Dec  5 16:32:55 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* callbacks.c (s_call_interactively): Fix dumb bug of trying to
	free a literal string.

Sun Dec  5 14:50:02 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.h, window.c: Added ScmArgsFromInteractiveSpec and
	document it (not very functional yet, but the infrastructure and
	some simple specifications are in place now).

	* callbacks.c: Make `call-interactively' use
	ScmArgsFromInteractiveSpec to build the argument list.

Sun Dec  5 12:53:31 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c, resize.c, miscprocs.c: Added interactive
 	specifications to SCWM_IPROC macros.

	* scwm.h, scwm.c: Update scwm_make_igsubr to take the
	szInteractiveSpecification argument.

	* scwm-snarf.h (SCWM_IPROC): Pass along the
	interactive-specification to scwm_make_igsubr.

	* cursor.c, color.c: Fix const-warnings, adding GJB:FIXME:CONST to 
	revisit later when guile's const-ness is better.

Sun Dec  5 12:09:55 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c (scwm_make_igsubr): Use sym_interactive from events.c's
	declaration of it, instead of a function-static one.

	* resize.c: Make rubber-band-resize and opaque-resize interactive.

	* events.c: Added 'interactive symbol.  Use new call_interactively
	instead of scwm_safe_call0 when dispatching mouse/keyboard events.

	* callbacks.h, callbacks.c: Added `call-interactively'

Sat Dec  4 12:33:57 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* *.c: Fix un-escaped double-quotes in docstrings.

Fri Dec  3 13:19:29 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm-snarf: Drop everything after $$$ so that the docstring
	extraction is not included.

	* scwm-doc-snarf: Added -- for extracting the docstrings from the
	last argument to the macro.

	* scwm-snarf.h, *.c, *.cc: Updated SCWM_*PROC and SCWM_*HOOK
 	macros to have docstrings as last argument instead of as a comment
 	just after the macro.

Fri Dec  3 10:11:34 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.h (VALIDATE_ARG_WIN_ROOTSYM_OR_NUM_COPY): Check
	WINDOWP(arg) before VALIDWINP(arg) to avoid gh_cdr call on
	non-pair.  Fixes a seg-fault bug in set-window-cursor!.

Fri Dec  3 10:10:27 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* cursor.c: ws change-- eliminated some stylistic comments that
	are not used consistently throughout Scwm.

Thu Nov 25 14:03:23 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.h, window.c: Added ScmWindowDelta(), ScwmWindowDeltaVP()
	to build XFORM objects for new multi-window animation stuff in
	c-animation.c.  Also added FScmIsWindowDelta() to see if the arg
	is one of those created objects.  Fixed typo bug caught by scwmdoc 
	on window-visibility's FUNC_NAME.

	* constraint-primitives.cc: Added `cl-resolve-xforms',
	`cl-reset-dirty-windows' primitives.  Set fInResolveHook to True
	while calling that hook so `animated-windows' can do the right
	thing.

	* add_window.c: Added fInResolveHook global variable.

Tue Nov 23 15:08:18 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c (mark_window): Use GC_MARK_SCM_IF_SET, and do not mark
	the mini_icon_image twice.

	* screen.h: ws change.

	* decor.c (mark_decor): Assert that fl->scmdecor is a back-pointer
 	to the object being marked.

Tue Nov 23 14:16:01 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* menu.c (SetPopupMenuPositionFromDecoration): Be sure that
	decoration popup menus stay on screen.  Thanks to Tessa Lau for
	the bug report.

	* scwm.c: Default to resetting 0 segvs (instead of 100); guile-gtk
 	is now not gratuitously segfaulting, so this resetting segvs is no
 	longer useful as the default.

Tue Nov 23 12:18:59 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.h: Added visibility field for tracking the current
	visibility of a window.

	* window.c: Added `window-visibility' procedure for returning
	symbol based on the tracked visibility field.

	* resize.c, move.c: Watch for visibility events during
	move/resize.

	* events.c: Update visibility field, and call hooks only when the
	frame window's visibility changes (not the client window)

	* add_window.c: Watch for VisibilityChangeMask events on frame,
	and initialize the new visibility field of windows.

Tue Nov 23 09:16:36 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xmisc.h,xmisc.c: Added SetXWindowGravity(..)

	* window.c: Mark other_properties only if set.  Added some gravity 
	code that is still #if 0-d out because it doesn't do the right
	thing.  Inspired by (but very different from) Owen Taylor's
	suggestions regarding resizing frames on the wmspec list recently.

	* focus.c: Mark a formal as unused.

	* add_window.c: Remove unused extern
	
Tue Oct 26 11:21:54 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* message-window.c: Avoid using pimg->mask if it is NULL.  Fixes
	some X11 errors on startup.

Mon Oct 25 12:23:02 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* message-window.c (MapMessageWindow): Do not use CWSaveUnder flag 
	as that causes a race to be lost.  Handle race gracefully  when lost.

Sun Oct 24 12:56:02 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* events.c: Fix docstring.

Sun Oct 24 12:05:10 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* message-window.c (CreateMessageWindow): Added CWSaveUnder bit
	(no noticeable effect, but seems desirable).

	* events.c: Only require either X/Y change to do the
	XMoveResizeWindow, not also a width/height change.  Fixes bug #12
	reported by bkirby.

Sat Oct 23 15:05:35 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* binding.c: ws change

	* events.c: Renamed send-key-press to `send-key',
	`send-button-press' to `send-button'.  Added dx, dy arguments to
	`send-button'.  Change suggested by E. Jay Berkenbilt -- thanks!

Sat Oct 23 14:16:03 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c: Do not decorate message-windows.  Thanks to Dirk Hermann 
	for the bug report.

Fri Oct 22 17:18:20 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c: Renamed `get-window-focus' to `window-focus-style'

	* events.c (HandleUnmapNotify): Clean up code a bit, and make
	iconifying work by at least doing the focus setting when we would
	have bailed out of the function really early.

	* add_window.c: Eliminate some code that's duplicated by
	HandleUnmapNotify;  this assumes we get the UnmapNotify event
	before any DestroyNotify event.

Fri Oct 22 15:54:23 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* events.c (HandleUnmapNotify): Only give pointer-window focus after
	an unmap of the focussed-window if the pointer-window is not click 
	to focus.

Fri Oct 22 15:46:13 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm_msg.h: Added SCWM_EVENT_DEBUG_MSGS define controlling new
	DBUG_EVENT for better tracing of events.

	* events.c, focus.c: Avoid giving focus to a window that already
 	has it (optimization, really).  Move the code that rearranges the
 	window list out of SetFocus() and put it into HandleFocusIn().
  	use WXGetPointerChild() instead of a less-obvious XQueryPointer
 	call.  Added trace debugging code using new DBUG_EVENT.

	* borders.c (SetBorderX): Be sure Scr.Focus (as well as
	Scr.Hilite) is set to the window that gets highlighted.

Fri Oct 22 09:18:03 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* add_window.c, borders.c, events.c, focus.c, scwm.c, shutdown.c,
 	window.c: Use False as second arg to XSync, not 0.

	* focus.c, shutdown.c: Use RevertToPointerRoot as third arg to
 	XSetInputFocus, not RevertToParent

	* screen.h: Drop UnknownWinFocused since it seems superfluous.
	May break colormap stuff, but there's gotta be a more appropriate
	way to do this stuff.

	* add_window.c, events.c: Simplify some focus handling (no
 	noticeable effect to me, but I could have broken something, of
 	course).

	* colormaps.c (InstallRootColormap): Use psw, not tmp.
	(HandleColormapNotify) Drop test of Scr.UnknownWinFocused since
	that variable is now gone.
	
Wed Oct 20 17:58:02 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c (scwm_main): Handle SIGINTs always so that the focus is
	restored properly; change SCWM_CATCH_SIGINT to
	SCWM_RESET_ON_SIGINT

Tue Oct 19 15:45:08 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c:  Added code from tguile-core.c (of
	hobbit-guile-1.3.4/unexec) to support --dump option which dumps a
	usable binary, but the state isn't yet correct.  Use --enable-dump 
	configure option to access it, and make symlink src/libunexec.a to 
	the guile-hobbit unexec/libunexec.a file.

	* Makefile.am: link against @UNEXEC_LIB@ that a configure-time
	option controls.

Tue Oct 19 09:02:21 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* message-window.c (s_message_window_set_image_x): Fix bug in
	message-window-set-image! when image is #f. Thanks E. Jay
	Berkenbilt for bug report.

	* window.inl: Do not add the boundary/border with for the
	MinFrame{Width,Height} since that results in too large of a
	frame.  Maybe I shouldn't be adding them in MaxFrame*
	either. GJB:FIXME::

Mon Oct 18 10:34:27 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am (noinst_HEADERS): Added window.inl to list.

	* window.h: Remove inline prototypes, and replace with #include of 
	window.inl

	* window.inl: Added -- includes all the inline functions from
	window.c, and is now #included at end of window.h

	* window.c: Move inline functions into window.inl

	* scwm-constraints.hpp, resize.c: Use new
 	{Max,Min}Frame{Width,Height} functions.  This should fix a bug in
	the display of wfcmgr windows that set their maximum client size
	that was being interpreted incorrectly as a maximum frame size.

Mon Oct 18 09:31:55 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* message-window.c (s_message_window_set_image_x): Permit #f as
	image argument, and use it to turn off the image.

Sun Oct 17 17:49:38 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.h: Added protos for scwm_make_(i)gsubr.

	* scwm.c: Do not catch SIGINTs unless SCWM_CATCH_SIGINT is
	defined.

	* events.h, events.c: Added fNoBlock parameter to NextScwmEvent
 	since handle_pending_events must not block, and Pass fNoBlock to
 	calls of NextScwmEvent().

Sun Oct 17 16:10:25 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* cursor.c: Use XC_right_ptr for menus by default.
	XC_sb_right_arrow (from last change) was the wrong one.

Sun Oct 17 10:51:49 1999    <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c: Use SCWM_IPROC for interactive procedures. Rename
	focus to `focus-window', iconify to `iconify-window', deiconify to 
	`deiconify-window', iconified? to `iconified-window?', stick to
	`stick-window', unstick to `unstick-window', sticky? to
	`sticky-window?', window-shade to `shade-window', window-unshade
	to `unshade-window', window-shaded? to `shaded-window?'

	* scwm.c: Initialize scm_init_heap_size_factor if it is available
	(from my Guile patches, uncommitted still).  Added
	scwm_make_igsubr for SCWM_IPROC.

	* scwm-snarf.h: Added SCWM_IPROC.

	* miscprocs.c: Use SCWM_IPROC for interactive procs.

	* cursor.c: Use XC_sb_right_arrow by default for the cursor in
	menus. 

	* binding.c: Fix improper validation of args in
	set-mod-mask-numlock! and set-mod-mask-scrollock!

Wed Oct  6 17:40:09 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* miscprocs.c (s_X_get_primary_selection): Fix some doc comment
	problems, bug in X-get-primary-selection.

Wed Oct  6 09:21:02 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* binding.c (IsClick): Also grab ButtonPress and ButtonRelease
	events, and fix use of DBUG macro.  Thanks E. Jay Berkenbilt for
	patch!

Tue Oct  5 18:22:05 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* binding.c (IsClick): Make this grab the pointer so we actually
	see the motion events.  This lets motion events fall out before
	waiting for the click timeout, and makes a noticeable nice
	improvement in the responsiveness of titlebar drags on motion
	events.   Also reduce to sleep only 5ms (instead of 20ms) so
	shorter double-click intervals are handled more accurately.

Mon Oct  4 23:05:19 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.h: Added fBorderWidthSet field

	* window.c (set_border_width_x): Set fBorderWidthSet.

	* add_window.c: Initialize fBorderWidthSet to False.

Mon Oct  4 22:54:19 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* decorations.c (SelectDecor): Use fBorderWidthSet as a test about 
	whether to allow changes to the boundary_width.

	* callbacks.c: Switch back to using the more long-winded
	scm_internal_stack_cwdr since I ran into an obscure and bizarre
	bug during testing select-window-interactively.

Mon Oct  4 14:07:40 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c (s_set_border_width_x): Only resize if
 	psw->fFullyConstructed.  This lets #:border-width be a hint, not a 
	style. 

	* decorations.c: Only tweak boundary_width in a couple places if
	it is currently < 0 (so #:border-width hints persist long enough
	to matter).

	* borders.h, borders.c:  Move NO_SIDE_DECORATIONS_P and
	NO_TOP_BORDER_DECORATION_P into .h file from .c file since the
	former is used by window.c, too.

	* add_window.c: Initialize psw->boundary_width to -1 so that we
	can tell if a border hint was given.

Sun Oct  3 15:41:18 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c: Rename current-window-with-{focus,pointer} to just
	window-with-{focus,pointer}

1999-10-03  E. Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* resize.c (makemult): Always round down.
	(ConstrainSize): Always round down when making size a multiple of
	the client's resize increment.  The old code rounded up if the
	pixel size was more than half way between two increments.  This
	may give the wrong answer when resizing windows to fit within a
	given area (such as the display).

Sat Oct  2 12:41:17 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* callbacks.c: Make error-hook call procs using the string error
	message instead of the list of throw arguments.  Simplify
	scwm_handle_error to use scm_handle_by_message_noexit, and write
	to a string port to support new-style error-hook.  Also simplify
	scwm_safe_apply.   There's lots more stuff that can be ripped out
	once our base guile is 1.3.4.

	* events.c: Drop the assert in HandleDestroyNotify -- a gtk window 
	closing caused pswCurrent to be set, so apparently it was possible 
	to get a window object from a DestroyNotify.

Sat Oct  2 11:09:50 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* events.c: Updated documentation for X-DestroyNotify-hook.

Sat Oct  2 10:44:06 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* events.c (HandleUnmapNotify): Move g_lastwin_entered variable
	earlier. Make DestroyNotify try harder to get a window object, but 
	assert that it never will, and instead call the hook on the X Id
	of the destroyed window since that might very well be all the
	information we can give.

	* window.h: Use VALIDWINP in VALIDATE_ARG_WIN_ROOTSYM_OR_NUM_COPY
	so that X-property-get does not seg fault on an invalid window.
	Use VALIDATE_ARG_WIN_COPY in VALIDATE_WIN_COPY,
	VALIDATE_ARG_WINVALID_COPY in VALIDATE_WINVALID_COPY.  Probably
	some VALIDATE_WIN_COPY calls should be VALIDATE_WINVALID_COPY, but 
	haven't exhaustively looked for these.  Thanks to E. Jay
	Berkenbilt for the bug report!

Sat Oct  2 00:07:10 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.h (DecorationYOffset, DecorationXOffset): Add protos for
	these.

	* window.c: Permit an unspecified width or height to mean leave
	unchanged.  Added FIXME's re: psw->bw in Decoration[XY]Offset.

	* miscprocs.c: Added #if-0'd code about XtGetSelectionValue.

	* events.h: Added *pscm_configure_request_handled variable, EXTERN 
	framework.

	* events.c: Added `X-ConfigureRequest-hook', call it and let it
	possibly hide the C handling if configure-request-handled variable 
	is set to #t by a hook proc.  Handle gravity properly in
	ConfigureRequest-s, so that, e.g., a font-size change in an xterm
	causes the window to change its size while respecting gravity and
	stay in a corner appropriately.

	* callbacks.c: Make scwm_run_hook save and restore pswCurrent
	(this was a problem at least one place).

	* add_window.h: Added EXTERN framework (unused).

1999-10-01  E. Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* miscprocs.c (s_X_fetch_bytes): added this function for cut
	buffer manipulation.
	(s_X_store_bytes): added this functino for cut buffer
	manipulation.  Simply setting the X property seems insufficient
	for clearing the cut buffer.  This code was basically stolen from
	gwm.
	
Thu Sep 30 17:22:05 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* resize.c: Patched to make InteractiveResize use the current
	position of the pointer as an anchor so that the mouse no longer
	first needs to move outside the window before "catching" onto a
	part of the window frame to resize.  Thanks to E. Jay Berkenbilt
	for tha patch!

	* resize.c:  Use 0xaaaaaa instead of 37 for the initial rubberband 
	mask.  Thanks to Carl Witty for suggesting the value, and E. Jay
	Berkenbilt for raising the question.

	* placement.c (SetPswGravity): Change the gravity attribute of the 
	window, not just the gravity hint.  (Not clear that this has any
	effect... I certainly didn't notice anything).

Wed Sep 29 23:04:46 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c (s_move_window_to_desk): Return immediately if moving
	window to the desk it is currently on.

	* placement.c: Added some debug code.  Call
 	MovePswToCurrentPosition() after interactive placement to
	eliminate the jumping of the mapped window from 0,0 to its final
	place.

	* icons.c: ws change, drop some unused code that was #if 0.

	* add_window.c: ws change.

Wed Sep 29 17:53:25 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* resize.h, resize.c: Added ComputeDeltaForResize() and use it in
	ComputePositionForResize(). 

Wed Sep 29 10:56:49 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* cursor.c (free_cursor): Return 0, not sizeof(*xp), since we did
	not use scm_must_malloc to allocate the memory.

Wed Sep 29 10:05:45 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* add_window.c: Added some debugging code and
	DBUG_ADDWINDOW{,_VERBOSE} macros.

Tue Sep 28 17:46:42 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* binding.c ("init_modifiers"): Do not warn about no scrollock, no 
	numlock-- lots of "bug reports" re: this non-bug.

	* add_window.c: Do not display startup messages about correcting
	for restart_vp_offset;  this works pretty well now.

Tue Sep 28 16:34:29 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* color.c (color_mult): Fix > to >=.  Thanks E. Jay Berkenbilt!

Tue Sep 28 14:40:25 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* events.c: Fix uninitialized g_lastwin_entered.  Thanks Marius
	Vollmer! 

Tue Sep 28 13:18:51 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c: Update name and copyright.

Tue Sep 28 09:53:40 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* face.c: Update `set-button-face!'s docs to refer to
	`set-left-button-face!' and `set-right-button-face!'

	* image.c: More fixes to avoid problems when libXpm is not present 
	-- do not try to register that loaded if the primitive `load-xpm'
	was not defined.

Tue Sep 28 08:27:16 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c: Bug fix from Rusty Chris Holleman: use sigjmp_buf, not
	jmp_buf;  this fixes the global-variables-changing corrupting bug
	on Solaris/SGI.  Thanks!
	
	* scwm.h: Move some macros into scwm-guile.h

	* scwm-guile.h: Added.  Various guile helpers for Scwm... was in
	scwm.h.

	* Makefile.am: Updated for above addition.

	* image.c: Do not guarantee that val_load_xpm is not SCM_UNDEFINED 
	since `load-xpm' is now compile-time optional so that Xpm library
	is not necessary.

	* **.c:  Replace SCM_DEFER_INTS, gh_defer_ints() with
	scwm_defer_ints() that calls SCM_REDEFER_INTS.  Replace
	SCM_ALLOW_INTS, gh_allow_ints() with scwm_allow_ints that calls
	SCM_REALLOW_INTS.  Remove the sandwiching around SCWM_NEWCELL_SMOB 
	since that is no longer needed because the cdr is set before the
	ID is set in the car.
	

Mon Sep 27 16:52:54 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c: Use setjmp/longjmp on non-BSD -- just a trial test to
 	see if sigsetjmp clobbers globals on Solaris/SGI but setjmp does
 	not.

	* image.c: Use HAVE_LIBXPM to guard include of xpm.h, load-xpm
	primitive.

	* icons.c: Drop gratuitous include if xpm.h

Mon Sep 27 15:25:45 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* menu.c: #ifdef out code if no XK_ISO_Left_Tab symbol (X11R5 --
	e.g., Solaris -- does not have it).  Reduces functionality a bit
	in that Shift-Tab won't go backwards in a menu for those users.

	* focus.c: ws change

	* callbacks.c: Added some debugging code, conditionally-compiled
	out. 

	* miscprocs.c: Added scwm_run_test_hook_0, scwm_run_test_hook_1
	iff SCWM_TEST_HOOK_PROCS is #defined.

Mon Sep 27 08:49:10 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c: Separate out ScwmReportX11Error function so it's easier
	to debug X11 errors/warnings.

Sat Sep 25 12:32:21 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c:  Turn on backtraces w/ positioning by default
	(guile-1.3.2 broke this).

Sat Sep 25 11:11:10 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* validate.h: Permit a value other than a symbol to escape a
	VALIDATE_ARG_SYM_USE_DEF so that the default can, e.g., be #f
	instead of a symbol (for later testing).

	* binding.c: Make `lookup-procedure-bindings' take a second
	argument, CONTEXT, to filter the list of bindings that are
	returned.

Fri Sep 24 20:39:23 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* menu.c (s_popup_menu): Use 0 as the default for warp_to_index,
	since -1 now means "last menu item"; gratuitous commented example changes.

Fri Sep 24 14:58:28 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* menu.c (PmiimMenuShortcuts): Let Shift-Tab go backwards in
	menus, and let that wrap from first to last, too.

Fri Sep 24 09:23:05 1999    <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* validate.h: Added VALIDATE_ARG_INT_MIN (no _COPY).

	* callbacks.c: Make `add-timer-hook!' use msec, not usec.

Thu Sep 23 15:34:27 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* menuitem.c (s_menuitem_properties): Return fIsForcedSubmenu

	* menu.c: Permit #t in warp-to-index to mean 1.

Thu Sep 23 11:41:23 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* focus.c (SetFocus): Set psw->timeLastFocussed.

	* add_window.c: Initilalize psw->timeLastFocussed;

	* window.h: Added timeLastFocussed (X11 Time) for breaking ties
	between windows with same ttLastFocussed.

	* window.c: Added `window-last-focus-x-time', use timeLastFocussed 
	as a tie breaker in compare_focus_time.

	* menu.h, menu.c: Move popup_menu prototype into beginning of
	menu.c since it is used only in menu.c.  Change fWarpToFirst to an 
	int warp_to so that items other than the first can be warped to.
	Add permit-alt-release-selection? to `popup-menu' primitive.

Tue Sep 21 13:48:27 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c: Added `decoration-size', Drop `resize-to', rename
	`resize-frame-to' to `resize-frame', now `resize-window' is
	implemented in Scheme in terms of resize-frame and
	decoration-size. Permit extra X,Y args to let resize-* do
	movements as well as resizes (for matching animated-resize-frame a 
	bit better)

	* miscprocs.c: Make `set-handle-segv!' set fHandleSegv just so
	that the C variable is kept in synch with the actual status.

Mon Sep 20 23:46:12 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* drawmenu.c (InPopupZone): Use /2, instead of *3/4 for
	InPopupZone to make the code match a change to draw-xpm-menu.c.

Mon Sep 20 22:44:58 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c: Added a missing ConstraintSize() call in
	SetScwmWindowGeometry to ensure that we do not ever resize a
	window to an incorrect size.  E.g., when this happens to XEmacs,
	it immediately requests a proper size, and that gets ugly.

	* resize.c: Drop some extraneous code that called
	SuggestSizeWindowTo a second time in the interactive resizing main 
	loop.  Drop erroneous comment.

Sun Sep 19 18:39:05 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.h: Added highlighted_nonant to ScwmWindow struct.

	* window.c: Use new redraw_border utility fn, use
	VALIDATE_ARG_WIN_COPY_USE_CONTEXT more.  Added
	`set-window-highlighted-nonant!', `window-highlighted-nonant',
	`set-nonant-highlight-color!', `nonant-highlight-color'
	primitives.

	* util.h, util.c: Added redraw_border().

	* scwm.c: Initialize Scr.nonant_highlight_color.

	* screen.h, screen.c:  Added nonant_highlight_color to ScreenInfo
	struct, mark it.

	* borders.c: Honour psw->highlighted_nonant and draw it
	appropriately.

	* add_window.c: Initialize psw->highlighted_nonant (and added
	initialization of number_cmap_windows that appeared to be missing).

Sun Sep 19 15:27:26 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c, focus.c: Doc fixes.

	* scwm-constraints.cc: Added some debug messages, catch edit use
	exceptions to avoid an abnormal termination.

Sun Sep 19 14:12:37 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* borders.c: added comment re: dynamic scoping in macro.

	* window.c: Added `window-decoration-ids',
	`set-window-id-background!'.  Betters docs for other fns.

Sun Sep 19 10:33:28 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* *.[ch]: MSFIX -> MS:FIXME::, FIXGJB -> GJB:FIXME::

Sun Sep 19 00:34:52 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.h: Use new-style SMOBs based on
	HAVE_SCM_MAKE_SMOB_TYPE_MFPE configure constant.

	* borders.c: Fix a macro to use do ... while(0)

Sat Sep 18 12:31:03 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xrm.c, shutdown.c, menulook.c, drawmenu.c, deskpage.c, cursor.c, 
	constraint-primitives.cc, borders.c, binding.c: Include guile-compat.h

	* scwm.h, guile-compat.h: Move UNSET_SCM and GC_MARK_SCM_IF_SET
 	into guile-compat.h (they are not scwm specific).

	* window.c: Add check on psw before dereferencing, add some braces 
	to help make code more clear.

	* focus.c: Added `focussable-window?' primitive and use it to
	simplify some window focus stuff. Might have broken some
	relied-upon behaviour... will wait for bug reports (works fine in
	my usage pattern).

Fri Sep 17 14:57:52 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm-snarf: Permit spaces in guile-snarf output.  Thanks Chris
	Holleman!

Fri Sep 17 12:04:43 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* menu.c (MenuInteraction): Invoke the unhover action when a
	shortcut key selects a menu item and dismisses the menu.  Thanks
	to bug report from E. Jay Berkenbilt.

Wed Sep 15 14:51:36 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* events.c (HandleClientMessage): Fix bug in testing wrong sense
 	of bool.  Duh.  This gets the gnome panel working pretty
 	completely again.

Tue Sep 14 13:02:10 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c: Invert sense of switch -- now --document-formals, and by 
	default they are undocumented.

	* events.c: Use scm_empty_hook_p, not FEmptyHook.
	(HandleClientMessage) Use PswFromAnyWindow, not PswFromWindow --
	this fixes the spurious selection problem with gnome-hints when
	collapsing the gnome pager. Thanks Jay Belanger for bug report!

	* callbacks.h: Added proto for scm_empty_hook_p, drop it for
	FEmptyHook(). 

	* callbacks.c: Drop FEmptyHook(), write scm_empty_hook_p for old
	guiles.

Mon Sep 13 22:45:59 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* binding.c ("init_modifiers"): Drop the "Doing n XGrabKey
	calls..." message-- put in a DBUG macro.  This message is mostly
	superfluous for the average user.

Mon Sep 13 22:21:50 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm-constraints.cc: Fix bug that resulted in resize hook not
	being invoked when constraint solver was not active.

	* callbacks.c: Update the number of args to error-hook -- there
	are 5.

Mon Sep 13 13:27:37 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c: Added --no-document-formals option to usage message.

Mon Sep 13 12:58:39 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winprop.c, module-interface.c, events.c: Use scwm_run_hook, not
 	apply_hooks.

	* callbacks.h: Drop apply_hooks{,_message_only}, add
	scwm_run_hook{,_message_only}

	* callbacks.c: Move scwm_handle_error to later in the file, after
	defn of scwm_run_hook_message_only.  Move WarnBadHook to earlier,
	and only ifndef HAVE_SCM_MAKE_HOOK

Mon Sep 13 11:57:10 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c: Added -N/--no-document-formals option to avoid the
	undefined quote (and save a bit of extra memory if user desires).

Wed Sep  8 18:11:02 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c: Renamed `window-class' to `window-class-hint' and
	`window-resource' to `window-resource-hint'.  Implement old proc
	names in scheme using WM_CLASS property.

	* xproperty.c: Added ScmListOfStringsFromStringLen and use it in
	X-property-get so that properties that have a bunch of strings in
	a single property get a list of strings returned (e.g.,
	WINDOW_CLASS).

	* focus.c: Added an extra guard to protect against a surprising
	seg fault.

Wed Sep  8 14:01:13 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm-snarf: Rewritten sed script by Ken Pizzini. Thanks Ken!

Tue Sep  7 17:51:28 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm-snarf: Use sed instead of awk, since vendor awk-s do not
	have sub/gsub commands.

	* events.c: Added a missing return statement.

Tue Sep  7 15:11:19 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c (scwm_make_gsubr): Only add documentation if we're using
	a recent guile-- I get a bug in guile-1.3 about `quote' being
	undefined when I load c-animation module.

	* events.c: Do not use cMotionHandlers -- just see if list becomes 
	empty to turn off MotionNotify event selection.

	* callbacks.c: Added scm_empty_hook_p that should be provided by guile.

Mon Sep  6 19:48:21 1999    <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c (s_list_stacking_order): Document that this skips
	iconified windows, and add FIXME comment.

Mon Sep  6 17:23:33 1999    <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): added scwm-snarf.

Mon Sep  6 17:07:14 1999    <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c (scwm_make_gsubr): Added this proc for more sophisticated 
	snarfing that saves a list of the formal parameter names.

	* scwm-snarf.h: More sophisticated snarfing of SCWM_PROC macros -- 
	needs new scwm-snarf script.

	* scwm-snarf: The new script that does better snarfing of
	SCWM_PROC macros to preserve the argument list (when combined with 
	macros in scwm-snarf.h, and scwm_make_gsubr in scwm.c).  See also
	the new ../Makefile.common for the rules for building .x files

Mon Sep  6 13:08:38 1999    <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* validate.h (VALIDATE_ARG_SYM_USE_DEF): Added this macro.

	* events.c: Use VALIDATE_ARG_SYM_USE_DEF in `send-button-press' to 
	default to a 'click operation (as it used to behave)

Sun Sep  5 21:25:13 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* guile-compat.h, guile-compat.c, events.c: #define gh_free, move
 	make_output_strport, scm_strport_to_string here from events.c

	* system.h: Guard gh_free against redefinition since I want it
	defined in guile-compat.h, too.

Sun Sep  5 13:20:00 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* menu.c (MenuInteraction): Permit the release of other modifier
 	keys to end a menu selection to give support for Alt-Tab switching 
	with modifiers other than Mod[12]Mask.

Sat Sep  4 14:43:22 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm-constraints.cc: Added a missing value from a return
	statement (Thanks John MacPhail!).

Sat Sep  4 00:15:39 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* events.c: Added symbols 'press, 'release, 'desk-press,
	'desk-release, 'desk-click (in addition to 'click) to be used for
	`send-button-press' primitive so it can be used to send the
	synthetic events for root-click proxying for GNOME.  Clean up
	argument handling a bit.

	* binding.c: Fix bug in not initializing *pmodifier in
	FButtonToBnumModifiers().

	* window.h: Added VALIDATE_ARG_WIN_ROOTSYM_OR_NUM_COPY_USE_CONTEXT 
	macro.

	* scwm.c: Added comment re: E's event mask.

	* message-window.c: Added `message-window-id'

Fri Sep  3 10:55:56 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* menu.h: Change DYNAMIC_MENU_P and DYNAMIC_SAFE_MENU to check
	scm_symbol_bound_p before using scm_symbol_binding since the
	latter will throw an error.  This makes unbound symbols used as
	action items in menus error when they are clicked on, not when the 
	window is popped up.  (Dirk Hermann reported this as a bug).

Thu Sep  2 17:53:14 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c: Use ComputePositionForResize() in ResizeTo().  Use
 	VALIDATE_ARG_INT_OR_UNDEF in convert_move_data(), and check for
 	UNSET_SCM, not == SCM_BOOL_F.

	* validate.h: Added VALIDATE_ARG_INT_OR_UNDEF, some assignments
	for warning suppression (and a comment about why they're there).

	* resize.h, resize.c: Added ComputePositionForResize().

Thu Sep  2 15:38:58 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* binding.c: Only display warning message about unbound modifier
	once.  Use FUNC_NAME in init_modifiers.

Thu Sep  2 13:45:32 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c: Added `select-window-done-hook', and call it.

	* scwm.c: Set basic_event_mask variable and use it or (it |
	MotionMask) for XSelectInput depending on whether there is a
	motion handler.

	* events.c: Added support for a MotionHandler, update comments.
	Added `add-motion-handler!', `remove-motion-handler!',
	`reset-motion-handler!'.

	* callbacks.h: Added SCWM_MAKE_HOOK macro.  Delete old #define impls 
	of calln_hooks in #if 0 (use inline defns in callbacks.c).

	* callbacks.c: Use scwm_run_hook, not scm_run_hook if
	HAVE_SCM_MAKE_HOOK. Write scwm_run_hook using
	scwm_safe_apply. This fixes bug where errors in hook procedures
	would terminate Scwm.

Wed Sep  1 14:43:59 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* placement.c (SetPswGravity): Call XSetWMNormalHints so that
	gravity persists through Scwm restarts.

Wed Sep  1 10:46:29 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am (noinst_HEADERS): Added scwm_msg.h

Wed Sep  1 10:25:15 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.h: move scwm_msg stuff into scwm_msg.h so it can be
	included w/o all the other scwm.h stuff.

	* scwm.c: ws change.

	* scwm_msg.h: Added

Tue Aug 31 08:51:10 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c (s_show_titlebar): Call SetBorderX so that the border
	gets redrawn properly.

	* events.c (HandleFocusIn): Call window-focus-change-hook before
 	the SetBorder call (so that any changes to the border by the hook
 	are accomplished before redraw).

Mon Aug 30 21:27:35 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c (set_window_internal_title_height): Fixed for non-NW
	gravity windows.

Mon Aug 30 20:19:34 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am (guile_snarfs): Added focus.x (added hook there).

Mon Aug 30 20:16:17 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c, virtual.c, icons.c, events.c, add_window.c, window.c:
	Use Bool as last (3rd) arg to SetFocus instead of 0/1.

	* focus.c: Added `window-focus-lost-hook'.  Rename Fw local to psw 
	for readability.  Added init_focus() function, and use focus.x to
	create it (for initializing the hook-- first hook in file).

	* scwm.c: call init_focus().

Mon Aug 30 15:57:06 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* binding.c (init_modifiers): Only populate the mask_mod_combos[]
	with those that are non-zero.  Switch warnings re: missing dubious 
	modifiers to just INFO messages, and remark on the number of
	XGrabKey calls for window bindings.  Added
	`ignore-dubious-modifiers?' getter, and update docs on
	`undo-all-passive-grabs' and `redo-all-passive-grabs'

Mon Aug 30 12:18:21 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm-constraints.cc (SuggestSizeWindowTo): Return a bool for
	whether the window size was changed.

	* scwm.c: Added commented out hack from Hubert Canon to work
	around weird sigsetjmp corrupting global variables bug.

Mon Aug 30 12:10:06 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.h, scwm-constraints.h, add_window.h, add_window.c: Make
 	SetScwmWindowGeometry return True iff the window was
 	moved/resized, False otherwise.

	* resize.c: Use SuggestSizeWindowTo's return value for determining 
	whether to call the hooks for a new position.

	* borders.c: Redraw the titlebar right after a XMoveResizeWindow
	-- this is a bit wasteful if no expose event is generated, but
	reduces flicker noticeably if the titlebar does need re-drawing.

	* window.c: FIX comment re: overkill of SetupFrame() call in
	ResizePswToCurrentSize. 
	
1999-08-30  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Explicitly mention include dir so that
	srcdir != builddir works.

Mon Aug 30 10:20:25 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am (scwmpaths.h), scwm.c: Rename SCWMDIR to SCWMRCDIR

Fri Aug 27 09:26:49 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xmisc.c: Remove duplicate JunkChild, JunkRoot vars.

	* window.h: assign to cvar in macro (avoids compiler warning)

	* validate.h: Assign to pch in all paths of macro (avoid compiler
	warning)

	* scwm.c: comment out some unused variables (avoid warning)

	* cursor.h: Use EXTERN on *pscm_cursor... variables (avoid
	duplicate definitions).

	* callbacks.c: Reorder a bit to make calln_hooks all inline, and
	have them return values.

Wed Aug 25 16:25:39 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* events.c (HandleScwmExec): Use initial length of 0 in
	make_output_strport -- the non-zero length apparently needs to be
	initialized and wasn't, resulting in a lot of garbage.

Wed Aug 25 15:24:50 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c (scwm_main): Fix typo bug in resetting
	restart_vp_offset_y twice, not restart_vp_offset_{x,y}

	* events.c: Do not care about return value of
	scm_set_current_{output,error}_port() when returning to old values.

Wed Aug 25 14:05:02 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm-snarf.h: Fix SCWM_GLOBAL_HOOK macro (had only fixed
	SCWM_HOOK macro before) to use HAVE_SCM_MAKE_HOOK

Wed Aug 25 12:24:17 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c: Drop the setting of *suppress-old-style-hook-warning*.

	* events.c: Rename get_strport_string to scm_strport_to_string,
	and define it only if guile does not already have it.  (scwmexec
	protocol was broken using the old code).

Wed Aug 25 00:13:26 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm-snarf.h: Use HAVE_SCM_MAKE_HOOK to test for whether to use
	scm_make_named_hook()

	* module-interface.c, events.c: Fix number of arguments for
 	various hooks (guile-1.3.2 hooks check these).  Updated docs for
 	those hooks.

	* callbacks.c: Use new run-hook if HAVE_SCM_MAKE_HOOK;  leave old
	code in otherwise.
	

Tue Aug 24 23:40:37 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* binding.h, binding.c: Added const modifiers to func_name parameter

Tue Aug 24 14:17:19 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* binding.c: Added set-ignore-dubious-modifiers primitive to
	revert to the old (dumber) behaviour of treating all of the
	modifiers separately, even numlock/scrolllock.  This can be useful 
	for performance reasons.

Tue Aug 24 13:52:04 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* binding.c (init_modifiers): Don't include 0 in mask_mod_combos
	array (wastes an XGrabKey call) and use c_mask_mod_combos to
	control how much of the array is initialized (currently always
	7).  Print warnings if unable to determine numlock_mask and/or
	scrollock_mask.

Tue Aug 24 13:51:10 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c: Fix very small memory leak in not freeing an X11
	property after XGetWindowProperty.

Sun Aug 22 17:15:58 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* binding.c: Use 0 == AnyButton as argument to
 	XGrabButton/XUngrabButton instead of looping through all the
 	buttons.  Only call XGrabButton/XUngrabButton once with 0 or'd
 	into the modifier if modifier is not AnyModifier.
	Use None for the cursor when grabbing buttons.  Grab buttons on
	psw->frame, not psw->w  (keys were doing it that way.. not sure
	why that's better, but keys do not work reliably if the grab is
	done on psw->w).  Split remove_binding into remove_binding and
	remove_binding_from_list so that add_binding can call only the
	former and doesn't need to talk to the X server to XUngrab the
	previous binding.

Sun Aug 22 15:21:14 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* binding.c: Use new-style binding context names in documentation, 
	and eliminate the deprecated versions from the docs.  Update a
	warning message to use `' to enclose new name of context.

	* add_window.c: Update initial comments, add (C).

Sun Aug 22 11:39:49 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c (window_pixel_size_to_client_units):  Do not
	subtract-out the base_width/base_height if the
	width_inc/height_inc is 1.  This fixes a bug whereby, e.g., gimp's 
	main toolbar window had the size reported incorrectly when
	resizing the frame.  It would report 0x0 when at its minimum size, 
	now it properly reports its frame size.

Sun Aug 22 11:33:16 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* guile-compat.c (scm_internal_cwdr_no_unwind): Reduce the leaking
 	by about 75% (tested when doing focus switches and opaque moves of
 	windows); process image still grows a bit, but it's better.
	Something else must be leaking too.  All I did to eliminate the
	leak of 176 bytes per each call was explicitly scm_must_free the
	pRootContinuation, and always reset that field in the scm_rootcont 
	object to NULL so the gc does not try to take care of it, too (and 
	re-free already freed memory)

Fri Aug  6 10:35:10 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c (DeferExecution), resize.c (InteractiveResize), move.c
 	(InteractiveMove): Added False arg to NoEventsScwmUpdate() to let
 	that block (as it was doing anyway); Move the ms_sleep(10) into
 	the #else clause of the NOT_MORE_RESPONSIVE since if the
 	NoEventsScwmUpdate blocks, we don't need to sleep.

	* menu.c: Fix bug in menu-hover-delay-- was returning
	cmsPopupDelay, not cmsHoverDelay.

	* menu.c (MenuInteraction): Use True as arg to
	NoEventsScwmUpdate() so that it will not block, and we can call
	the hover/popup procs as we should.  Thanks John Kodis for the
	bug report!  Also finer-grain some of the debugging code.

1999-08-04  Jeff W. Nichols  <jwnichls@cs.washington.edu>

	* binding.c: Fixed a bug in which a reference to the binding list 
	was saved prior to calling remove_binding in add_binding.  This 
	caused a list loop when removing the first element in the binding
	list and put scwm into an infinite loop.

1999-08-02  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* session-manager.c: Remove `SM-client-id' (was deprecated). Use
	`SM-register' instead

1999-08-01  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* binding.h, events.c: Use PbndFromXXXX, not PBindingFromXXX..

	* binding.c: Make remove_binding take a bnum_or_keycode argument
	instaed of both button and keycode arguments.  Fix calls to it,
	calls to PBindingFromXXXX fns that have been renamed.  Added new
	primitive `number-of-mouse-buttons'.

Sat Jul 31 20:09:06 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* binding.c (remove_binding_keysym): Added this function as a
	helper to remove_binding and make the latter take a keycode not a
	keysym. This enabled easier writing of the new primitive
	`unbind-keycode' which was conspicuously missing.

Sat Jul 31 19:31:22 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* miscprocs.c (s_get_mouse_event): Fix bug of using = instead of
	==.  Thanks -Wall -W!

	* scwm.h: Move ARG_UNUSED, ARG_IGNORE macros out into
	arg_unused.h, and include that file.

	* scwm.c: conditionally #include XTest.h.

Fri Jul 30 16:15:33 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* placement.c: Simplify some over-parenthesization.

1999-07-27  Jeff W. Nichols  <jwnichls@cs.washington.edu>

	* virtual.c: Modified viewport-position-change-hook to
	return two additional arguments, the delta x and y values
	from the previous viewport position.

Tue Jul 27 10:49:12 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* virtual.c: Uncomment the C-level logic for the window focus on
	desk changes... it was more involved than I thought.  Added an
	after_change_desk_hook for, e.g., changing the focussed window.

Tue Jul 27 08:42:40 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c (SigDoneSegv): Move the call to XSynchronize if debugging 
	to earlier, and ifdef-out the XSetInputFocus to the NoFocusWin --
	that stole focus way too soon, and I don't think Scwm should be
	messing with the user's focus at startup, anyway.  Thanks Stephen
	Tell for noticing the negative effects my early July changes had.

	* virtual.c (changeDesks): Added some ifdeffed-out code for
	setting the focus to the current window on a change of desks.
	Better to use the change-desk-hook, if that works.

1999-07-26  Jeff W. Nichols  <jwnichls@cs.washington.edu>

	* message-window.c: Values returned from message-window-position
	and message-window-size are placed in gh_int2scm or gh_double2scm
	converters as appropriate.  Also modified message-window-size to
	return the current size of the message window, regardless of whether
	certain dimensions are set to auto-size.  (Perhaps another method
	could be added to return which dimensions are autosizing)

Mon Jul 26 12:19:57 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* icons.c (GrabIconKeys): Bug fix from Stephen Tell; only grab
	keys if its not a mouse binding.

Sat Jul 24 22:29:22 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c (get_window): Return #f if the car from
	select-viewport-position is not a window object (it now might be a 
	window id).  Otherwise all code that checks (if win ...) has to
	instead do (if (window? win) ...).

Sat Jul 24 19:07:20 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c: Simplify DeferExecution-- select-viewport-position was 
	returning #f incorrectly for first constraint creation and it was
	due to some obsoleted code choosing to return #f instead of the
	selected window.

	* image.c: Added note re `clone-resized-image' in docs for
	`clone-scaled-image'. 

Sat Jul 24 13:25:12 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.h: Added def of struct _ImlibData before using it in an
	extern.  

Fri Jul 23 23:39:03 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.h: Added extern of imlib_data (now needed by image.c) 

	* image.c, image.h: Rename SMOB image to scwmimage-- was having
 	problems due to a global name conflict of imlib's free_image and
 	scwm's SMOB free_image.  Set imlib to use the default visual of
 	screen; was getting BadMatch X11 errors on XCopyArea when drawing
 	buttons on a Sun machine's Solaris display because imlib creates
 	pixmaps at the best visual (by default) instead of the
 	DefaultVisual which is used when creating the windows for the
 	buttons.

Fri Jul 23 21:48:05 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* callbacks.c (s_set_load_processing_frequency_x): Use /** instead 
	of just /* so doc extractor notices the comment.

	* validate.h (VALIDATE_ARG_LISTNONEMPTY): use gh_pair_p, not
	gh_car to check if a list is not empty.  Fixes seg fault reported
	by Francesco Tapparo.

Tue Jul 20 08:23:24 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* callbacks.c (s_set_load_processing_frequency_x): Added
	`set-load-processing-frequency!' to control how many s-exps are
	read between load-processing-hook invocations.

Tue Jul 20 08:21:19 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* validate.h: Duh.  Use SCM_UNDEFINED to terminate a gh_list, not
	SCM_EOL.  Fixes nasty-looking seg faults when errors are thrown.

Mon Jul 19 15:25:07 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* binding.c: Only display warning message about unbound modifiers
	for modifiers that are actually unbound, not for every modifier
	given on a binding that contains an unbound modifier.  Also,
	return #t on successful binding/unbinding of keys instead of
	SCM_UNSPECIFIED (was returning #f on errors, but need to be
	consistent).

	* resize.c (s_set_rubber_band_mask_x): Return SCM_UNSPECIFIED, not 
	the passed in value.

Sun Jul 18 17:28:51 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Thanks to Stephen Tell for scwm/3 scwm/4 bugs re: building on
	HP/UX.
	
	* message-window.c: #include <X11/extensions/shape.h>, and move
	include of message-window.h to first.

	* events.h, callbacks.h: Added #ifdef HAVE_SYS_SELECT_H to guard its inclusion.

	* events.c: remove inclusion of sys/select.h, since it includes
	events.h

Sun Jul 18 16:39:45 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* binding.c: Added `undo-all-passive-grabs',
	`redo-all-passive-grabs', `undo-passive-grab', `redo-passive-grab'

	* events.c (HandleKeyEvent): Added USE_XALLOW_EVENTS cpp check for 
	commenting out some code.  Drop the use of XTest since that won't
	work anyway.

	* miscprocs.c (get_mouse_event,get_key_event): Return lists
	containing the string as the car, but the raw information in the
	cdr. 

Sun Jul 18 14:50:01 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* binding.c: Fix VALIDATE_... call for lookup-procedure-bindings
	to really work when passing #f or no arguments to return the list
	of all bindings.

Sun Jul 18 13:45:59 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* events.c: Removed #if 0 from the HandleVisibilityNotify() event
	handler.  Invoke new window-*obscured-hooks on these events.

	* add_window.c: Only display message about moving a window if
	a restart_vp_offset_x/y is nonzero.

Sun Jul 18 01:41:54 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* add_window.c (AddWindow): Move the windows to their correct
	viewport (from last shutdown) later than before so that sticky
	windows are correctly identified.

	* binding.c (s_lookup_procedure_bindings): Permit #f as PROC to
 	return all bindings (really simple generalization). Provide better
 	warning regarding punctuation when a binding fails because of an
 	unmatched keysym name.

	* scwm.c (SigResetLoop): UngrabServer, Pointer, Keyboard when
	resetting to the event handler.

	* miscprocs.c: Added `get-mouse-event'.  Change `get-key-event' to
 	look for a KeyPress of a non-modifier key, not a KeyRelease, so
 	that I don't need to use a timer hook to test (and because it
 	seems better that way, anyway-- it's probably going to be bound to
 	a keystroke which needs to be released and we don't want the
 	release event.)

Sat Jul 17 23:04:49 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xproperty.c (s_X_property_get): Fix bug in that GetXProperty
	was not returning NULL on failure (and `X-propert-get' was not
	checking the return value anyway).  Gimp tickled this bug in that
	windows popped up then disappeared so quickly that the window was
	gone by the time the X-propert-get was done.

Sat Jul 17 21:22:36 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c (MovePswToCurrentPosition): Improve message about
	moving sticky window so it tells the correct new position.

Sat Jul 17 19:04:06 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* binding.c:  Replace binding_contexts and context_strings
	parallel arrays with an extended symnum struct that contains the
	string, too.  Reorder the array so that depracated symbols are all 
	at the end.  Warn about deprecated symbols used in contexts, and
	suggest correct version.  Make `lookup-mouse' return both the proc 
	and the new immediate-proc.  Added `lookup-procedure-bindings' and 
	several helper functions to convert internal binding
	representation out to Guile lists.  Added `keymask->string' for
	modifier conversions when there is no keycode (e.g., for the mouse 
	bindings).

Sat Jul 17 12:53:33 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xmisc.h, xmisc.c (NFromXPropertyCardinal): Added this fn.

	* window.c: Move sticky windows off of the viewport back onto the
	viewport (but not to 0,0 like the old ifdef-fed out code did).
	Warn user that we did this via scwm_msg(ERR,..).

	* scwm.c, add_window.c: Use SCWM_VIEWPORT_OFFSET_X/Y Root window
 	properties to correct for position of windows that were not on the
 	viewport during a previous scwm termination (e.g., when
 	restarting).  Also use them to go back to that viewport at
 	startup.

Sat Jul 17 03:09:33 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* virtual.c (MoveViewport_internal): Added comment.

	* placement.c: Fix off-by-one bug in CleverPlacement -- was
	correcting for bw differences, but that seems wrong given that the 
	algorithm's job is to figure out where the *frame* goes.

	* window.c (s_get_window): Fix bug -- was using select_p after
	copying the bool into a C boolean.  Also was assumming that
	select_viewport_position() puts SCM_BOOL_F in car if a scheme
	window object was not selected -- now test the car with WINDOWP
	since a window id can be returned.

	* binding.c: Added `set-mod-mask-numlock!',
	`set-mod-mask-scrolllock!' for overriding the C algorithm, if
	necessary. 

	* add_window.c: Fix off-by-one bug in setting frame_height that
	was resulting in un-titled windows shrinking by 1 pixel vertically 
	at each restart.

Sat Jul 17 02:08:08 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* binding.c: Only grab buttons when context is C_WINDOW.  Ignore
	the various locks in PBindingFromMouse() as I do in PBindingFromKey().

Sat Jul 17 01:28:40 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* virtual.c (MoveViewport_internal): Fix bug in setting of
	XA_SCWM_VIEWPORT_OFFSET_X/Y -- give &Scr.Vx/y instead of the
	number itself. (Was causing segfaults, obviously).

	* scwm.c: Fix typo just like above in #ifdef-fed out
	AnnounceGnomeCompliancy().

	* icons.c, focus.c, add_window.c: Do not call
 	XGrabKey/XGrabButton; using binding.c's GrabKeyWithModifiersWin(),
 	GrabButtonWithModifiersMaskXcPm(), UngrabButtonWithModifiersWin,
	etc.

	* binding.h, binding.c: Major clean up button/key grabbing stuff.
  	Figure out what mask numlock and scroll-lock are, make bindings
 	and Grabs for all 8 combinations of the various lock states so
 	that bindings are independent of keyboard lock state.

Fri Jul 16 17:56:59 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xmisc.h, xmisc.c (Pixmap1DeepFromPixmap): Move this function
	here, from cursor.c

	* cursor.c: moved Pixmap1DeepFromPixmap to xmisc.c.

	* virtual.c: Set XA_SCWM_VIEWPORT_OFFSET_X,
 	XA_SCWM_VIEWPORT_OFFSET_Y on root window in MoveViewport_internal
 	so that they are always current.

	* scwm.h, scwm.c: Added XA_SCWM_VIEWPORT_OFFSET_X,
	XA_SCWM_VIEWPORT_OFFSET_Y atoms.  Protect shape stuff with
	HAVE_SHAPE.  Set some XTest globals from XTestQueryExtension

	* message-window.c: Improved `message-window-set-image!' to take
	fg, bg, and shaped? parameters, and permit them to be shaped
	windows.

	* icons.c, events.c, borders.c, add_window.c: Protect XShape fns w/ HAVE_SHAPE

	* events.c: Have commented out code using XTestFakeKeyEvent --
	does the wrong thing since Scwm still grabs the key. Duh.

	* deskpage.c: Fix validate bug in set-desk-size!.  Thanks Jay Belanger.

Thu Jul 15 09:33:36 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c (s_select_viewport_position): Return window id instead
	of #f if a window was selected.  Now #f is returned only if the
	selection failed. (select-window is changed to provide old
	behaviour at that level of the API).

Wed Jul 14 10:05:18 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xproperty.h (VALIDATE_ARG_ATOM_OR_STRING_COPY): Added this
	macro. 

	* xproperty.c: Use VALIDATE_ARG_ATOM_OR_STRING_COPY, other
	validate macros.

	* window.h: Added ttCreated field of struct ScwmWindow.

	* window.c: Fix some warnings; added `window-creation-time',
	updated docs on `window-last-focus-time' to remove mention of
	using X server times (they wrap pretty frequently -- added comment 
	to that effect).

	* virtual.c: Fix warning by including "events.h"

	* shutdown.c, drawmenu.c, decorations.c, font.c, decor.c,
 	cursor.c, borders.c, binding.h, binding.c:  Fix warnings

	* scwm.c: Fix some warnings re: unsigned/signed comparisons.

	* screen.h: Make ClickTime an unsigned int for fixing warnings.

	* placement.h: Added proto for GravityFromSym().

	* message-window.c: Require image object in
	`message-window-set-image!' (do not permit #f).  Permit
	`message-window-set-position!' to use #f in a position argument to 
	mean "no change" of that coordinate.

	* image.c: Fix warning by including "xmisc.h"

	* events.c: Include events.h

	* callbacks.c: Added `load-processing-hook', call it every five
	top-level sexps. Drop bogus arg to `reset-input-hook!'

	* add_window.c: Fix warnings, set psw->ttCreated when
	re-parenting.

	* Makefile.am:  Use @PREFIX_INCLUDES@ in @INCLUDES@

Fri Jul  9 15:07:02 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c: Fix order of arguments in calls to
	select_viewport_position;  the cursor argument is now the third
	argument. 

	* ICCCM.c: Generalize send-client-message to take a rest argument
	with up to 4 integers to fill the ClientMessage event's data.l[..]
	fields.  Do complete error checking on the arguments.

Fri Jul  9 09:13:29 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* resize.c (s_set_rubber_band_mask_x): Permit to be in range
	[0,+Inf]; 65535 was a poor choice before.

Fri Jul  9 09:04:22 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Added -DGUILE_CPLUSPLUS_SNRF to arguments to guile-snarf 
	when building .x from .cc files.  This is only useful when using a 
	patched version of snarf.h that adds a cast to the last argument
	to scm_make_gsubr when GUILE_CPLUSPLUS_SNARF is defined (that cast 
	eliminates spurious warnings on those function calls).

Fri Jul  9 08:58:24 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c (select_viewport_position,get_window): Use
 	VALIDATE_ARG_CURSOR_COPY_USE_KILLORCIRCLE to do the right thing
 	with values #t and #f for the cursor (was getting run-time errors
 	about uses of #t for the kill cursor)

	* scwm.c: Change the SigDoneSegv message to suggest running with
	--segv-just-stop or --segv-reset-count 0, and call scwm_msg only
	once instead of once per line.

	* resize.c: Permit rubberband mask in [0,65535], not just [0,255]

	* menuitem.h, menu.h: Added self field to Menu and MenuItem
 	structures, a pointer back to the scheme object. Need this to be
	sure we can protect/unprotect the object so that they don't get
	gc-d when we're still using the guts of the objects from
	DynamicMenu and MenuItemInMenu instances.

	* menu.c: Initialize self fields, and use
	scm_protect_object/scm_unprotect_object to ensure menuitems and
	menus don't get gc-d while the menu is displayed.

	* cursor.h: Rename and fix VALIDATE_ARG_CURSOR_COPY_USE_NONE to
	VALIDATE_ARG_CURSOR_COPY_USE_KILLORCIRCLE

Thu Jul  8 12:20:02 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am: 

Mon Jul  5 20:26:08 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* *.c, *.h: Updated copyrights to include 1999.

	* binding.c: Removed duplicate copy of "icon" (for C_ICON) in the
	binding_contexts array. Rename local variables in remove_binding
	(they were called temp and temp2).  Added scm_unprotect_object()
	calls in remove_binding (and remove comment about them leaking
	since they shouldn't any longer-- not a big leak anyway, but this
	is better).

Mon Jul  5 19:33:37 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* validate.h (VALIDATE_ARG_DBL_MIN_COPY): Added a missing SCM_EOL
	to a gh_list call.

Mon Jul  5 19:28:24 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* events.c (HandleButtonPress): Call the ReleaseThunk (the
	immediate click procedure) right away and use its return value to
	determine whether to bother with the find_mouse_event_type
	garbage.

	* binding.h: Added comment w/ ReleaseThunk member of binding re:
	its use as an immediate click procedure for mouse bindings.

	* binding.c: Added immediate-proc argument to bind-mouse, and
	handle it.  Also cleanup an old ifdef.

Mon Jul  5 18:50:31 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Removed mention of complex.[ch]

	* binding.c: Moved IsClick() from obsoleted complex.c into here.

	* complex.c, complex.h: Removed -- moved their only function,
	IsClick(), into binding.c

Mon Jul  5 17:24:51 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* events.c: Remove spurious unmatched SCM_REDEFER_INTS.  These all 
	need to be re-visited from scratch, I believe.

Mon Jul  5 16:55:25 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c: Clean up DeferExecution a bit -- fix its return
	value.  Simplify some of it.  Still a mess, but not as bad,
	perhaps.

	* xrm.c, xproperty.c, window.c, shutdown.c, resize.c, placement.c, 
	module-interface.c, miscprocs.c, message-window.c, menulook.c,
	menu.c, image.c, font.c, face.c, deskpage.c, decor.c, color.c,
	callbacks.c, binding.c, ICCCM.c: Updated to use VALIDATE_XXXX
	macros more consistently.

	* image.c: Added `image-short-name' calling new SzNewImageShortName().

	* cursor.h, decor.h, face.h, font.h, window.h, image.h: Added some
 	VALIDATE macros

	* cursor.h, cursor.c: Added szName to scwm_cursor struct, and get
	it from the image object's SzNewImageShortName() fn.  Update the
	print procedure to display a name if the cursor has one.

	* validate.h: Added more VALIDATE_XXX macros for procs, lists,
	half-ranges, etc. o

	* xproperty.h: Added VALIDATE_ARG_ATOM_COPY (now needs assert.h,
	too).

Mon Jul  5 00:02:57 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* binding.c (s_keymask_keycode_to_string): Handle bad keycodes w/o 
	segfaulting -- return #f.

Sun Jul  4 22:56:39 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.h: Added psym to struct gravity_info_tag so I can map
	between symbols and X gravities, and the table.

	* window.c: Introduce gravity symbols, make ResizeTo honour the
	window gravity, added `window-gravity' and `set-window-gravity!'.
	Remvoed some #ifdef 0'd symbol definitions (no-top-border,
	no-side-borders, no-border).

	* validate.h: Added VALIDATE_ARG_DBL_COPY,
	VALIDATE_ARG_DBL_COPY_USE_DEF macros (for message-window)

	* placement.h, placement.c: Added sym_grav_XXX to grav_table
	array. Added SetPswGravity, GravityFromSym.

	* message-window.c: Updated doc string for
	message-window-set-position! -- it had arg description wrong, I
	think.  Greatly simplify that procedure, too, by using VALIDATE
	macros.

Sun Jul  4 21:36:47 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Added @XTST_LIB@ to link scwm_LDADD

Sun Jul  4 21:21:13 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.h, window.c: Added fInPlace argument to
 	set_window_internal_title_height.  Make windows that are shaded
	have WM_STATE set to WithdrawnState (they were NormalState; it's
	conceivably that they should go to IconicState, but that implies
	to me that their icon is visible, which is not the case).

	* util.c, decor.c: Pass False to fInPlace for
	set_window_internal_title_height. 

	* miscprocs.c: ws typo fix.

	* events.c: Honour fQuotingKeystrokes flag, but do only a send
	events sending of the key (it's a synthetic event).

	* binding.c: Added `set-quote-key-events!' and `quote-key-events?'
	to set fQuotingKeystrokes variable.
	

Sun Jul  4 18:40:04 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* virtual.h, scwm.c, screen.h, events.c: Eliminate NON_VIRTUAL
 	compile-time option.

	* events.c: Fix bug in xterm active icons whereby the xterm would
	send configure notify events that Scwm incorrectly interpreted as
	referring to the client window instead of as to the pixmap icon
	window (added a check to see if the event's window was
	icon_pixmap_w (used to only check for icon_w)). Thanks George
	Hansper for the bug report!

	* binding.c: Added list of contexts to the docs for bind-key, and
	xref for bind-mouse.

	* virtual.c: Fix bug in initializing the scroll-region variable
	that was causing edge enter events to appear to do nothing.

Sun Jul  4 14:52:32 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* binding.c: Eliminate harmless compiler warning.

	* miscprocs.c (s_get_key_event): Do not change the event mask for
	Scr.NoFocusWin -- it already is watching for KeyRelease events, so 
	let it be (bug was that I was resetting the mask, thus
	un-selecting events that should've been selected -- this made some 
	bindings appear to not work, when actually X just wasn't passing
	on the event.

	* virtual.c: BroadcastIconInfo of icons on other desks so that
	they don't appear to move (since the Fvwm modues use viewport
	positions, they need to be told when the viewport location of an
	icon changes, which corresponds to when the viewport-offset
	changes). Also simplify handling of focus in changeDesks -- just
	call CoerceEnterNotifyOnCurrentWindow, and let the EnterNotify
	event do the right thing.

Sat Jul  3 23:55:50 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* events.c: Simplify HandleButtonPress and HandleKeyEvent by using 
	new PBindingFromMouse and PBindingFromKey fns.

	* binding.h, binding.c: Added PBindingFromKey, PBindingFromMouse;
	new primitives `lookup-key', `lookup-mouse'

Sat Jul  3 20:56:38 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* binding.c (s_keymask_keycode_to_string): Doc string fix.

Sat Jul  3 18:17:38 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* miscprocs.c (s_get_key_event): Got this primitive working, and
	eliminate its previous confusing arguments.

	* binding.c (SzKeysymForKeyCode, SzNewModifierStringForModMask,
	SzNewForModMaskKeyCode): Added new primitive
	`keymask-keycode->string' for getting a string for binding to a
	certain keymask and keycode.

	* binding.h: Added protos for new fns.

Sat Jul  3 00:16:25 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* image.c: Added `image-size' for simpler, faster interface to a
 	common case.

Fri Jul  2 22:24:21 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* virtual.c: Rename global C variable from cpix_scroll_region to
	scroll_region to match scheme name of value.

	* image.c: Doc comment fix.

Fri Jul  2 15:08:24 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* image.c (s_clone_scaled_image): Added `clone-scaled-image'
	primitive (when compiled with imlib) for resizing image objects.

Fri Jul  2 10:03:11 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

 	Various bugs and doc problems from documentation extractor:
	
	* window.c: Fix FUNC_NAME for any-id->win.

	* virtual.c: Added docs for scroll-region variable.

	* miscprocs.c: Rename X-connection-number to x-connection-number.

	* message-window.c: Fix args params to message-window-set-size!

	* image.c: doc fixes for `window->image'.

	* cursor.c: Fix args params to `create-pixmap-cursor'

	* callbacks.c: doc,args fix to `reset-input-hook!'

Fri Jul  2 08:40:31 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* message-window.h, message-window.c: Drop the message field of
 	scwm_msgwindow struct, and add a char *sz instead; just convert to
 	C string on set-message! primitive, then don't do so much memory
 	allocation and deallocation.  Factor out MessageWindowWidth(),
	MessageWindowHeight() functions.  Make C functions static as
	appropriate, clean up some stylistic issues.  Still need to make
	msg windows permit multi-line messages.

Thu Jul  1 22:58:29 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* message-window.c: Fix alignment bug-- use manual sizes if
 	desired before computing the position.

Thu Jul  1 22:40:07 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* message-window.h: Added macros: MSGWINDOW_IMAGE(),
	VALIDATE_ARG_MSGWINDOW{,_COPY}.  Added scwm_msgwindow struct
	members width, height, and bg_image.

	* message-window.c: Added background images, manual sizing.  Clean 
	up lots of argument handling (use VALIDATE_* macros), many bug
	fixes, documentation improvements.

Thu Jul  1 22:23:07 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* image.c: Added MakeScwmImageFromImlibImage() helper. Use it in
	load-imlib-image, and for new `window->image' primitive for
	capturing a window's contents as an image.

Thu Jul  1 16:28:00 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xproperty.c: Use new VALIDATE_ARG_WIN_ROOTSYM_OR_NUM_COPY macro
	for `X-property-set!'

	* xmisc.h, xmisc.c: Added XColorFromPixel().

	* window.h, window.c: Added VALIDATE_ARG_WIN_ROOTSYM_OR_NUM_COPY
 	macro, make sym_root_window extern in header, not in window.c

	* scwm.c: Suppress msg about runing w/ --segv-reset-count 0 if the 
	reset count is zero.

	* image.c: Improve warning message.

	* cursor.h: Added VALIDATE_ARG_CURSOR macro

	* cursor.c: Added `set-window-cursor!' and `create-pixmap-cursor', 
	along with helper Pixmap1DeepFromPixmap.

Thu Jul  1 10:02:05 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* face.c, colors.c: Added fixme comments re: gradient stuff using
	colorname strings instead of color objects.

Wed Jun 30 10:39:15 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* image.h: Added VALIDATE_ARG_IMAGE macro

	* guile-compat.c: Added a /* scope comment */

Tue Jun 29 16:25:05 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* session-manager.c: #ifdef out all code if HAVE_LIBSM_LIBICE is
	not defined.  (Thanks Stephen Tell!)

Tue Jun 29 15:56:23 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* message-window.c (free_msgwindow): Print better debug message if 
	a window is visible when it is freed;  it shouldn't be as shown
	windows are protect-ed from GC, and unprotect-ed from GC only
	after they are hidden.  Also, only do the checks #ifndef NDEBUG,
	and call UnmapMessageWindow instead of the higher-level
	message_window_hide_x procedure.

	* syscompat.c (setenv): Added, for platforms w/o setenv-- uses
	putenv (and hence #includes <stdlib.h>)

Tue Jun 29 15:14:08 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c (AnnounceGnomeCompliancy): Added GNOME_SUPPORT_IN_C
 	conditional directive to permit announcing GNOME support more
 	quickly than the Scheme module gnome-hints.scm version of it.  Not
 	sure if it's necessary yet, so leave it off by default.

	* guile-compat.c: Added comment about where the memory leak is
	occurring for Maciej to fix it.
	
Sat Jun 26 13:36:25 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xrm.c, xproperty.c, window.c, message-window.c, image.c, face.c,
 	events.c, decor.c, color.c, callbacks.c, binding.c: Use gh_free,
 	instead of FREE, to free gh_scm2newstr allocated memory.

	* virtual.c: New variable `scroll-region'.  Only raise pan frames
	if they are going to be used (cut down on interactions with x2x
	keyboard/mouse multiplexer).

	* font.c: Added comment.

	* system.h: Added gh_free macro, DEBUG_C_ALLOC instrumentations.

	* scwm.h: Drop SCROLL_REGION-- use var in virtual.c, now.

	* menu.c: Only free pmd->pmenu->pchUsedShortcutKeys if non-null.

	* events.h, callbacks.h: Use sys/select.h, for AIX (Thanks Jeff Nichols!)

	* constraint-primitives.cc: Use ClSolver *, not ClSimplexSolver *
	as arg to ScwmClvChanged.

	* callbacks.c: Added `reset-input-hook!'
	
Sun May  9 14:37:54 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* events.c: Invoke X-PropertyNotify-hook even when the property is 
	deleted.

Sun May  9 09:45:57 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* shutdown.c (restart): Fix FREE(sz) that was in error
	(harmlessly, but still wrong). Thanks Jim Blandy!

Fri May  7 08:34:34 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* color.c: Use float.h, not values.h, and DBL_MAX, not
	MAXDOUBLE. Thanks Bob Pepin.

Tue May  4 16:50:54 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* events.c (HandleScwmExec): Mis-bracketed last change... doh!

Tue May  4 16:16:30 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* events.c (HandleScwmExec): If first XGetWindowProperty fails,
	then do not keep trying -- reset saved_bytes_after to 0 so it will 
	exit.  Not sure if this takes care of the problem I am seeing or
	not...

Tue May  4 13:04:06 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* color.h: Added borrowed field to colors to mark those colors
	that are borrowed from other applications and should not be freed
	by Scwm with XFreeColors (was getting a BadAccess X error
	message).

	* color.c: Do not XFreeColors if sc->borrowed (avoid BadAccess X
	error).  Set borrowed in ClosestColor.

Mon May  3 21:04:59 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c: Added `any-id->window' for getting the window from any 
	window id of an application.  Especially useful for mapping from
	emacs frame id-s to the scwm window object.

Mon May  3 19:51:53 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c: Fix order of arguments in typechecking macros (thanks
	scwmdoc!)

Mon May  3 15:49:32 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* *.[ch]: Clean up vim lines at ends of files so the close comment 
	"*/" is on the following line.

Mon May  3 15:14:00 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* miscprocs.c: #ifdef out `get-key-event' since I never finished
 	getting it working and it does not work yet.

Sun May  2 18:22:37 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c: Added missing BroadcastConfig calls to
 	set_window_highlight_{foreground,background}_x,
 	set_window_{foreground,background}_x

	* color.c: Added missing BroadcastConfig call when redrawing the
	highlight window from a global highlight color change.

Sun May  2 15:26:01 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.h: Re-introduce SCWMWINDOW to just be an accessor, and
	make PSWFROMSCMWIN return NULL if the valid flag is 0.  SCWMWINDOW 
	is used only as an lvalue right now, and should probably stay that 
	way.  This and the below fix a nasty race condition that I was
	finally able to reproduce reliably while playing with tooltips for 
	XEmacs.

	* window.c (ScwmSaveContextPsw): Introduce this fn as a partial
 	layer of abstraction over the setting of ScwmContext.  Make it
	store the scwm_window *, not the ScwmWindow*.  This fixes a nasty, 
	pervasive race condition. Update PswFromWindow and
	PswFromAnyWindow to return NULL if the window is no longer valid.

	* add_window.c, icons.c: Use ScwmSaveContextPsw.

Sat May  1 17:49:50 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c: Fix `stick' primitive again-- need to have sticky set
	properly before changing the window's position.
	(convert_move_data) fixed bug in not returning *pStart[XY] in
	virtual coords.

Sat May  1 14:27:43 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c:  Fix `stick' primitive to not do the modular
	arithmetic.  This way making windows move when stuck.  

	* window.c,resize.c,move.c,menu.c: Added #ifndef
 	NOT_MORE_RESPONSIVE for conditionally turning off calls to
 	NoEventsScwmUpdate outside the main loop (in case it is a
 	stability issue... not sure yet).

Sat May  1 13:42:22 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* callbacks.c (force_new_input_hooks): Should have used gh_pair_p, 
	not gh_list_p in change below.

Wed Apr 28 19:59:05 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* callbacks.c (force_new_input_hooks): Be sure SCM-s are lists
	before dereferencing.  Not sure that it's necessary, but it is
	safer. 

1999-04-28  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* borders.c (SetShape): Correctly check for title bar presence.
	(SetTitleBar): Relieve title bar even when squashed.
	(SetupFrame): NW corner was misplaced.

Tue Apr 27 20:46:42 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* callbacks.c (scwm_handle_error): Ugly hack to avoid a throw in
	  DEREF_LAST_STACK in a desperate attempt to squash one of the
	  bugs that seems to happen at random times in the hopes that Scwm 
	  won't crash when I demo it to RMS tomorrow.

Sun Apr 25 19:49:23 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c: Change the format for printing X11 errors (only if not
	  Xmu library)

	* callbacks.c: Added some comments for Maciej in
	  scwm_handle_error. Drop the return SCM_BOOL_F, so that the hooks 
	  get called.  We need to improve error hook documentation and
	  handling before Scwm-1.0;  I'd like to be able to generate the
	  backtrace from the procs in the error-hook.  We could pass the
	  string to the error hook, or we may need to pass the stack
	  object to the hook procedures.

Sun Apr 25 18:49:16 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm-constraints.hpp: Use ClsMedium-strength stay constraints
	  for frame width/height instead of just perturbing the weight to
	  be greater than the x/y position.  Prefer moving to resizing.
	  Requires CVS version of Cassowary

Sun Apr 25 16:16:53 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* menu.c: Fix bug in menu-properties -- was using gh_scm2int
	  instead of scmint2scm in creating list to return.

	* drawmenu.c: Make the HLTextColor default to the menu text color
	  when menu-hl-fg-color is #f -- it was using black in error.

Wed Apr 21 19:22:56 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* color.c (ClosestColor): Added this new function, and use it in
 	ScmMakeColor.  Just does full search with a closeness metric, only
 	operates for 8 bit (or fewer) display (I cannot test elsewhere now).

Wed Apr 21 18:00:55 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c: Only mark set scheme objects (could've extended the
	area where interrupts were disallowed, too).  Use XCURSOR_* macros 
	to access global cursor objects instead of XCursorByNumber.

	* scwm.c: Call CreateScmGlobalCursors.

	* add_window.c move.c, menu.c, icons.c, focus.c: Use XCURSOR_*
 	macros to access global cursor objects instead of XCursorByNumber.

	* cursor.c, cursor.h: Define XCURSOR macros, pscm_cursor_ vars,
	CreateScmGlobalCursors().  Fix bug in get_scm_cursor_by_number --
	return SCM_BOOL_F, not SCM_UNDEFINED.

Wed Apr 21 16:35:47 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c, window.h: Update order of args to ensure_valid,
	get_window.  Drop FIXMS comment about the reordering of the
	arguments (I hope we agree on what the order should be!)

Wed Apr 21 15:48:03 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* *.c, *.h: Added vim modeline to end of file.

Wed Apr 21 15:10:16 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* cursor.c, cursor.h: Added

	* Makefile.am: Added cursor.[ch], cursor.x as appropriate.
	
	* window.h, window.c: Dropped enum_cursor; added the various
 	window decoration cursors to the window structure, and mark
 	them. (GrabeEm) takes Cursor, instead of enum cursor, same with
 	(DeferExecution), (select-viewport-position).  Switch order of
	first two arguments for select-viewport-position; move the cursor
	argument to the third position (from first) for get-window.

	* resize.c, move.c, menu.c, icons.c, focus.c, events.c,
 	drawmenu.c, binding.c, virtual.c: Use XCursorByNumber instead of
 	the Scr.ScwmCursors array.

	* add_window.c (AddWindow): Initialize cursor objects of window
 	struct when creating a window.
	
	* validate.h: Added VALIDATE_ARG_INT_RANGE_COPY

	* scwm.h: Added ARRAY_SIZE macro and #include cursorfont.h

	* scwm.c: Call init_cursor(), drop CreateCursors().

	* screen.h: Drop ScwmCursors array.

Wed Apr 21 14:37:44 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* cursor.h, cursor.c: Cursor object support from Toby Sargeant.

1999-04-19  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* xproperty.c (X-property-set!, X-property-get, X-property-delete):
	Also accept window ids.
	(X-properties): New function that lists all properties on a window.

Mon Apr 19 13:04:40 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c (DeferExecution): Use eventp->xbutton.[xy]_root,
	instead of just .[xy].  This should report viewport positions even 
	in decorations of the frame for `select-viewport-position', but
	untested.

Mon Apr 19 10:17:41 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* move.c: Convert ints to SCM in call3_hooks. Duh.

Fri Apr 16 14:49:04 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* move.c (InteractiveMove): Call the
	interactive_move_new_position_hook consistently with viewport
	coordinates and document it as such (the last call was using
	virtual coords).

	* image.c (free_image): Don't dereference through si if it's NULL, 
	other safety tests.  (Modified from James LewisMoss's 2nd patch to 
	add the free-ing).  Untested since I'm building without imlib for
	a while.

Fri Apr 16 12:26:07 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* callbacks.c: Added accessors to timer-hooks, input-hooks.  Can
	we ensure that these aren't changed from the Scheme level?
	They're useful for debugging, but are probably problematic if
	messed with.

	* add_window.c: Move the creation of the window object a little
	bit later.

Fri Apr 16 12:24:09 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* image.c (free_image): Call Imlib_free_pixmap,
	Imlib_destroy_image if USE_IMLIB.  Thanks James LewisMoss.

Thu Apr 15 19:24:28 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* events.c: Added `handle-pending-events';  this lets
	delete-multiple-windows-interactively work like a charm since the
	killed window can be removed from the display.  This procedure
	would let Scwm have the main thread of control in Scheme, instead
	of C (not an explicit goal, just an off-the-cuff observation about 
	its power).

	* window.c: Doc fix.

	* menuitem.c: Export `menuitem?' primitive

Thu Apr 15 12:59:23 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* *.c: Drop SCM_SETGC8MARK calls in mark functions -- gc hands
	objects to us already marked (thanks Greg Harvey for pointing this 
	out!)

	* scwm.h: Call SCM_SETCDR before SCM_SETCAR in SCWM_NEWCELL_SMOB
	-- a bit safer, and will be fine when gc is changed as Greg Harvey 
	suggests it might be.

Wed Apr 14 15:09:12 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Build fixes: added scwm-screen-ci.hpp to
	cassowary_headers, validate.h to noinst_HEADERS

1999-04-13  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* events.c (HandlePropertyNotify): Remove unnecessary setting of
	window-context before calling X-PropertyNotify-hook.

Mon Apr 12 14:41:45 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* colors.c: Couldn't -> could not.

	* color.c: Small memory leak on an error condition (not
 	responsible for the leak Sam Steingold is seeing).

Mon Apr 12 12:21:14 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winprop.c: Use VALIDATE_ARG_WIN_COPY, VALIDATE_ARG_SYM.

	* window.h: Added fFullyConstructed field, make "valid" of
	scwm_window a bool.  Added SET_VALIDWIN_FLAG macro to change the
	value, instead of overloading the use of VALIDWINP as a setter and 
	a getter.

	* window.c: Use SET_VALIDWIN_FLAG, not VALIDWINP when setting.
	Move #define FUNC_NAME "literal_string" to *after* the opening curly
	brace of the function definition so etags doesn't get
	confused (same change as made below to lots of files).  Added
	`window-fully-constructed?', `window-mapped?', and
	`window-map-pending?' window state predicates. Fix
	set_window_internal_title_height to not call MoveResizeTo when the 
	window is not fully constructed.

	* add_window.c: Move GetWindowSizeHints, GetMwmHints, GetOlHints
 	before before-new-window-hook is invoked.  Set fFullyConstructed
 	after window is fully constructed.  The before-new-window-hook is
	the only place where window-fully-constructed? should return #f
	for a window.  Various C functions should probably be sure they are
	operating on fully constructed windows (as
	set_window_internal_title_height does now, see above).  Also the
	#define FUNC_NAME patch (see below).

	* validate.h: Added VALIDATE_ARG_SYM.

	* scwm.h: Drop extra semi-colon from GC_MARK_SCM_IF_SET macro def.
	

Mon Apr 12 10:18:52 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* session-manager.c, scwm.c, resize.c, menu.c, log-usage.c,
	icons.c, face.c, events.c, drawmenu.c, borders.c, Grab.c: Move
	#define FUNC_NAME "literal_string" to *after* the opening curly
	brace of the function definition so etags doesn't get
	confused. N.B., the SCWM_PROC macro is a special case that etags
	is taught to recongnize via a regexp so the usage of #define
	FUNC_NAME can remain the same there.

Sun Apr 11 19:23:26 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* add_window.c: Ensure psw->buttons is initialized to 0 when
	constructing new window object.

	* menu.c: Doc fix.

	* decorations.c: Just set ScwmWindow's nr_{left,right}_buttons to
	Scr.nr_{left,right}_buttons for now. Not sure if we even use this
	any longer.

	* borders.c: Make CLeftButtons, CRightButtons really return the
	right number (used for sizing the titlebar, perhaps among other
	things).  But do *not* use CLeftButtons/CRightButtons for the
	upper bound of loops over buttons -- CLeftButtons/CRightButtons is 
	how many buttons are to be shown on each side, not the highest
	button numbers that might be shown.

	* resize.c: #include util.h for ms_sleep.

Sun Apr 11 17:27:36 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* move.c, resize.c, window.c: add a ms_sleep(10) when looping calling
	NoEventsScwmUpdate() so it blocks a little bit;  we really need a
	better blocking mechanism.

	* events.c: Do not run input hooks when the server is grabbed --
	causes GTk+ windows to hang if manual placement is used.

	* Grab.h, Grab.c: Add and export CServerGrabs, new primitive
	`X-server-grabs'. Updated some docs, fix some possible future
	races.

Sat Apr 10 20:30:03 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* drawmenu.c: Biggish rewrite of the menuitem flexibility stuff I
	implemented too quickly yesterday.  Added HLBGColor, HLTextColor
	to MenuDrawingInfo-s, drop TextColor and font.  Move TextColor and 
	font into MenuItemDrawinInfo struct, and have that have a BGColor
	value, too.  Manage all the drawing and color setting -- this code 
	has too much optimization in avoiding GC manipulation; it cannot
	be *that* expensive to mess with GCs.  Get the height of an item
	right based on the items font size -- do not assume they'll all be 
	the same height.

	* menu.h: Added scmHLBGColor, scmHLTextColor to menus-- does not
	seem to make sense to let the highlight color change on a per item 
	basis.  Also added fHighlightRelief to permit turning off
	relieving if the highlight colors are to be used exclusively for
	indicating the selected menu item.

	* menu.c: Mark new objects, provide getters/setters:
	`(set-)menu-highlight-colors(!)',
	`(set-)menu-highlight-relief(!/?)'

	* color.h: Added SAFE_COLOR_USE_DEF and DYNAMIC_SAFE_COLOR_USE_DEF 
	macros since I was thinking 0 was a valid out-of-range value for
	Pixels (but it's not-- it's often black! duh!)

Sat Apr 10 17:16:30 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* events.c (HandlePropertyNotify): Call the X-PropertyNotify-hook
	on all property changes by pulling that code outside of the
	default clause of the switch, and out to just after the switch
	statement.  Wierd setting of the window context before the hook
	invocation-- what's this all about?  Added GJB:FIXME:MS: comment.

Fri Apr  9 17:05:02 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* menuitem.h, menuitem.c: added scmBGColor scmFGColor scmFont
 	fields, and mark them and provide getter/setters for them.

	* drawmenu.c: Use the menuitem bg,fg color and font if they are
	set for each menuitem, otherwise use the menu defaults. (Similar
	changes to draw-xpm-menu.c).

Fri Apr  9 12:14:38 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* menuitem.c: Fix bug I just introduced.

	* menu.c: Make some code a bit more robust w.r.t. NULL ptrs.

Fri Apr  9 10:56:30 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c: Fix typo in FUNC_NAME def.

	* validate.h:  Added VALIDATE_ARG_PROC_* macros.

	* menulook.h: Added VALIDATE_ARG_MENULOOK_OR_SYM macro

	* menulook.c: Renamed menulook? to menu-look? for consistency.
	Added a bit more documentation to the Menu Looks concept.

	* menuitem.h: Added VALIDATE_ARG_MENUITEM* macros.

	* menuitem.c: Use VALIDATE_ARG_ macros to simplify funcs.

	* menu.h: Added VALIDATE_ARG_MENU_* macros

	* menu.c: Rename the menu_menu functions to only include "menu"
	once (corresponds to change in base.scm where, e.g., set-menu-font!
	is changed to set-default-menu-font!).  Use VALIDATE_ARG_* macros
	to simplify funcs. Added set-menu-colors!, set-menu-font!,
	set-menu-side-picture!, set-menu-background-picture!,
	set-menu-extra-options!.  Fixed bug w.r.t. a null pmiim getting
	used. 

	* image.h: Added VALIDATE_ARG_IMAGE_* macros

	* font.h: Added VALIDATE_ARG_FONT_* macros

	* color.h: Added VALIDATE_ARG_COLOR_* macros

	* borders.c, events.c: Drop SQUASHED_TITLEBAR_P abstraction-- just access
	psw->fSquashedTitlebar directly (the macro was poorly named as it
	accessed a psw, not an SCM).

Thu Apr  8 17:40:27 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.h: Added tbar_right field since SetBorderX now needs it
	and it's computed in SetupFrame.  BE SURE TO REBUILD ALL MODULES
	AFTER THIS CHANGE!

	* window.c: Comment an empty if conditional. Twiddle a shaded & squashed
	setup-frame parameter.

	* borders.h: Expose SetShapedTitlebar -- animated-window-unshade
	needs it.

	* events.c: ResizePswToCurrentSize when squashed titlebar and the
	window title changes (since the titlebar may need adjusting).

	* borders.c: Make squashed titlebars look a bit nicer-- uses the
	top side as just above the client area (instead of above the
	titlebar), gets the top-right corner correct, turns off relieving
	of the title bar, and sizes the shaped window appropriately.  Also 
	relieves the top side only from the end of the title bar over to
	the right.  Should be no change for non-squashed-titlebar
	windows.  Fix the shaped window for squashed titlebars to not
	include the window frame if the window is shaded.

	* resize.c: Resize properly when grabbing the NE corner of a
	squashed window.  Also round when constraining the size to the
	client units, instead of truncating (better behaviour even for
	non-squashed windows).

Sun Apr  4 01:04:42 1999  Carl R. Witty  <cwitty@newtonlabs.com>

	* events.c (HandleClientMessage): Add missing break.

	* face.c (add_spec_to_face_x): Allow a button style pixmap of
	'mini-icon as well as 'mini-program-icon (as documented).

Thu Apr  8 14:11:10 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* borders.c, windows.c: Dropped some spurious "puts" calls
	(presumably from old debugging code from Maciej's
	set-window-property changes?)

1999-04-07  Sam Steingold  <sds@goems.com>

	* window.c ("set_squashed_titlebar_x!"): removed a spurious
	`printf'.

1999-04-07  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* session-manager.c (setSMProperties): Support xsm's broken idea
	of SmDiscardCommand.

Wed Apr  7 17:40:14 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c (DeferExecution): make DBG msg into DBUG macro so it
	compiles away (i.e., remove some debug output).

Wed Apr  7 10:32:01 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c (scwm_main): Handle SIGFPE, too

	* resize.c (ConstrainSize): Be sure to not divide by zero.  Added
	some warning messages if we would have so we can better track down
	the cause of the problem.

	* events.c (HandleLeaveNotify): Remove unused variable.

Wed Apr  7 07:48:44 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xmisc.h, xmisc.c: Added WxGetWindowParent().

	* window.h, window.c: Added PswFromAnyWindow() to return the
 	ScwmWindow * from any of the child windows of the frame or the
 	frame (not just the frame itself as PswFromWindow() does).  Added
	select_window_enter_hook, select_window_leave_hook and invoke them
	when top-level windows are entered and left during
	`select-window-interactively-no-message'

	* menu.c (MenuInteraction): Update c10ms_delays after the first
	time through the loop so that a 0 delay for hover/popup works.

	* events.c: Fixed window_enter_hook, window_leave_hook-- these
	hooks were incredibly broken as they got the enter/leave notify
	events on the frame decorations, too, and called the hooks too
	often.  Now I watch only for enter events and call the leave hook
	when a new window or the root window is entered.  This gives much
	more useful behaviour (I can't imagine anything relying on the old
	calling pattern, but this would break any code that did).

Tue Apr  6 12:51:52 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* *.[ch]: Use highlight instead of hilite or hilight.

Mon Apr  5 15:29:23 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.h: Added protos for newhandler_doreset, newhandler
	scwmgtkhelper.c and miscprocs.c both use them.

	* scwm.c: Move fHandleSegv into a global so it can be used by
	scwmgtkhelper.c.  Also drop the SIGNAL_FOR_RESET abstraction-- it
	was done sloppily anyway.

Fri Apr  2 13:52:05 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c: Added arg to option --segv-cleanup-and-stop, and rename to
	--segv-reset-count.  Fix SigDoneSegv's message to talk about the
	proper name of the option.

	* binding.c: Permit CSM-Left, not just C-S-M-Left.  (Motivated by
	its simplifying the fvwm2rc-to-scwmrc converter a tiny bit, but
	this is the right thing for now -- ultimately keys should be
	first-class).

Thu Apr  1 19:18:39 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c (s_destroy_window): Do not permit destroy if the window
 	leader matches gh_lookup("gdk-leader-window") which gets set in
	(app scwm gtk) module (once I decide to check that code in--
	probably not until after guile-gtk-0.16 if that has my patch).

	* session-manager.h, session-manager.c: Remove interning of
 	XA_WM_CLIENT_LEADER -- now done in scwm.h

	* scwm.h: Added extern Atom XA_WM_CLIENT_LEADER -- needed for
	destroy-window to protect gtk windows using their client-leader

	* scwm.c: Intern XA_WM_CLIENT_LEADER atom.  Change fResetOnSegv
	from a bool to segvs_to_reset, a count of the number of segvs that
	will result in a result (permits looping segvs to dump core
	instead of doing really ugly things).

	* miscprocs.c: set-reset-on-segv! now takes an integer, not a
	bool.  Added getter `reset-on-segv'.  Added `X-connection-number'.


Wed Mar 31 16:56:18 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* */*.c: Use SCM_UNSPECIFIED, not SCM_UNDEFINED as the return
 	value for side-effecting procs-- lots of latent bugs fixed!  Use
 	SCWM_WRONG_TYPE_ARG( instead of scm_wrong_type_arg(FUNC_NAME.

	* validate.h: Added string validation macros.

	* scwm.h, scwm.c: Fix char * args to const char *.  Updated usage
	message for --nobacktrace option.  Fixed short arguments, Added
	reset_signal_handler() and newsegvhandler() protos since
	miscprocs.c now uses them.  Added -p/-P options to manage what to
	do with segvs.  Do not do a newhandler_doreset(..) until after
	sigsetjmp has been called, and use newhandler_doreset for SIGINT,
	too.

	* miscprocs.c: Added `force-segv-for-testing!',
	`set-reset-on-segv!', `set-handle-segv!' primitives.

	* image.c: validate path_expand_image_fname args using new
	VALIDATE_ARG_STR* macros.

	* binding.h, binding.c: Added fShowError arg to
	FKeyToKeysymModifiers, honour it (`keysym->keycode' primitive
	shouldn't display warnings about bad keysyms as it can now be used
	to test validity of a keysym).  Validate these procs args better.

	* shutdown.c: reset_signal_handler(SIGSEGV) before generating the
	segfault to get the backtrace after cleaning up.

Tue Mar 30 20:09:59 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* events.c: Fix bug that scwmdoc caught in argnumber on a VALIDATE
	call.

	* window.c, face.c: Added use of new scwmdoc-understood /*SCWM_VALIDATE*/
	comment pointing out what the argument list is.  This isn't
	perfect as it's redundant with the prototype, but it's a quick fix
	(and already helped me catch one bug in face.c.  Also start using
	SCWM_WRONG_TYPE_ARG, instead of scm_wrong_type_arg when the
	function is FUNC_NAME.

Tue Mar 30 19:35:06 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* validate.h: Added -- contains VALIDATE macros for built-in
	types.

	* scwm.h: Remove COPY_* macros-- changed to VALIDATE_* macros and
	move to validate.h.  Added ARG_IGNORE, ARG_UNUSED macros

	* window.h: Move VALIDATE_* macros to top, and comment them;
	added some new ones, remove old stuff.

	* color.h: Move VALIDATE_* macros to top, added
	VALIDATE_ARG_COLOR_COPY_USE_BLACK macro.

	* window.c: Use VALIDATE_* instead of COPY_*.  Fix bugs in
 	set_squashed_titlebar_x (psw was never set), squashed-titlebar
	(validate arg, just in case). Annotated unused formals with new
 	ARG_UNUSED or ARG_IGNORE macro.

	* scwm-constraints.cc: Drop formal names when arg is unused (this
	is C++ so that's the right fix here)

	* winprop.c, shutdown.c, session-manager.c, scwm.c, screen.c,
 	message-window.c, menulook.c, image.c, icons.c, font.c, face.c,
	drawmenu.c, decor.c, color.c, callbacks.c, borders.c, : Annotated unused
 	formals with new ARG_UNUSED or ARG_IGNORE macro.

	* binding.c: Annotated unused formals with new ARG_UNUSED or
 	ARG_IGNORE macro.  (keysym_to_keycode) return #f for bad keysym.
	#ifdef out some unused functions.

	* Grab.c: use scwm_msg, not fprintf.

	* miscprocs.c, menuitem.c, menu.c, deskpage.c,: Annotated unused formals with new ARG_UNUSED or
 	ARG_IGNORE macro. Use VALIDATE_*, not COPY_*.


	* winprop.h: ws change.


Mon Mar 29 20:38:02 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.h: Define and use VALIDATE_WIN_USE_CONTEXT,
	VALIDATE_ARG_WIN_USE_CONTEXT, VALIDATE_ARG_WIN macros (replacing
	VALIDATE, VALIDATEN, and nothing, respectively, with arg order
	reversed), all using implicit FUNC_NAME macro as function name.

	* scwm.h: Added SCWM_WRONG_TYPE_ARG macro using implicit FUNC_NAME
	macro as function name.

	* color.h: Define and use VALIDATE_ARG_COLOR to replace
	VALIDATE_COLOR (arg order is reversed, FUNC_NAME is implicit).
	Drop unused, unneed VALIDATE_COLOR_OR_UNDEFINED,
	VALIDATE_COLOR_OR_NONE.

	* *.c: Update to use macros as above.  Fix several bugs, make WIN
 	parameter optional where it wasn't and update docs to reflect WIN
 	defaults to the window context in the usual way if not specified.

Mon Mar 29 14:33:33 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c: Doc fix to get-window-highlight-colors.

	* scwm.c: Move init_image() to as late as possible to defer imlib
 	loading when it is used (also image-support of any kind is totally
 	optionally, and nothing earlier could depend on this).

	* message-window.c:  Added Jeffrey Nichols to the (C), since this is
	largely his code.  Renamed ResizeWindow to ResizeMessageWindow for
	disambiguation.  Added `id->message-window' primitive as a last
	resort in case a message window has no easy way to get a hold of
	its object.  hide message windows when they are freed -- leaving
	one up that's been garbage-collected would be bad.

	* events.c: Replace an assert(False) with a warning about
	an unhandled format in a client message.  Sam Steingold tripped
	this assertion.

	* color.c:  Have ScmMakeColor return BLACK_COLOR instead of
	SCM_BOOL_F -- this was part of the point of my earlier reworking
	of this code, but I must've gotten sidetracked.  Now, e.g.,
	adjust_brightness will always get a valid color back, even if it's
	not the best one.

Mon Mar 29 11:28:40 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c, window.h, events.c, : rename window_context variable to scm_window_context,
	rename get_window_context C primitive to window_context.

	* window.c: Added `window-valid?'.  Thanks Eli Barzilay for the
	suggestion!

	* session-manager.c: doc fix.

	* miscprocs.c: FUNC_NAME fix.

	* face.c: Added note to Maciej re: add_spec_to_face_x (related to
 	a scwmdoc false positive).

Mon Mar 29 10:30:17 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* deskpage.c (s_set_edge_scroll_delay_x):  Document as ms, not
	usec, and use COPY_INTEGER_WITH_DEFAULT_OR_ERROR for arg
	processing. (edge-scroll-delay): updated doc.

Mon Mar 29 08:18:08 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* binding.c (s_bind_key): Doc fix -- grammar + remove trailing
	extraneous \".  Thanks Eli Barzilay!

Sun Mar 28 20:09:38 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* virtual.c (notify_edge_enter, leave): Fix bug 'east <->
	'west. Thanks Eli Barzilay!

Sun Mar 28 20:08:02 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* color.c: Separate make_color into ScmMakeColor, and argument
	processor.   Have ScmMakeColor set an error status, but always
	return a legitimate color if it returns.  Use ScmMakeColor from C
	code instead of make_color.

Sun Mar 28 18:23:21 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c (DeferExecution): Call NoEventsScwmUpdate() in the
	local select-a-window event loop.  Comment for the return values
	of convert_move_data.

	* resize.c, move.c:  Call NoEventsScwmUpdate() in the local
	move/resize event loops.

	* menu.c: Call NoEventsScwmUpdate() in the local menu-interaction
	event loop.

	* events.h, events.c:  Split new NoEventsScwmUpdate() function out
	of NextScwmEvent function so other event loops can call it.  This
	makes scwm more responsive during those local event loops.  E.g.,
	timer hooks can get executed while a menu is popped up, or a
	window is being resized, etc.  I expect some bugs will be exposed
	by this change, but it's the right thing, and we might as well fix
	those bugs now as they'll be a problem for the post-1.0 event rewrite.

	* scwm.c: Use sigsetjmp/siglongjmp to catch the SIGHUP signals
	more reliably for me (has setjmp behaviour changed in the new
	glibc?).  Warn on signal returning SIG_ERR.

	* miscprocs.c:  Added a scwm_last_timestamp. (Was for debugging,
	but very small and maybe worth having around).

Fri Mar 26 14:21:06 1999  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@racerx>

        * scwm-snarf.h (SCWM_PROPERTY_HANDLER): New snarf macro.
        * window.c: Use it.

Fri Mar 26 12:56:31 1999  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@alum.mit.edu>

        * callbacks.h, scwm-snarf.h (SCWM_HOOK, SCWM_GLOBAL_HOOK):
        SCMW_HOOK now lives in scwm-snarf.h and is a proper magical snarf
        macro like SCWM_SYMBOL, SCWM_PROC, etc. This should reduce
        unnecessary redundancy in the source and improve consistency.
        * add_windows.c, borders.c, callbacks.c,
        constraint-primitives.cc,, deskpage.c, events.c, icons.c, image.c,
        module-interface.c, move.c, resize.c, shutdown.c, virtual.c,
        window.c, window.h, winprop.c: Move instances of SCM_HOOK to the
        tops of files, where they now belong.

1999-03-26  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@alum.mit.edu>

	* window.c, window.h, events.c: Fix random brokenness from last
	checkin, handle squashed-titlebar as a window-property isntead of
	an object-property, and use set_property_handler to automagically
	redraw the window properly when the property changes.

	* winprop.c: Remove unnecessary debugging input.

1999-03-25  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* borders.c (SetShapedTitlebar): Would not detect window w/o title
	correctly.

1999-03-25  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@alum.mit.edu>

 	* winprops.c, winprop.h (set_property_handler): New function
 	allows C code to intercept property changes and reads through
 	`set-window-property!' and `window-property' for specific
 	properties. If a property change is intercepted this way, the
 	called setter is responsible for sending a property_change
 	notification.
 	* scwm.c: call init_winprops before init_window.
 	* window.c: use set_property_handler for the 'sticky window
 	property as an example.

Thu Mar 25 17:57:09 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* NOTE TO DEVS: Consider configuring with newish --enable-warnings
 	option.  I fixed lots of problems that this caught for me. (Option
	may be gcc-specific)

	* window.h: Added protos for Decoration{Width,Height}, comment for
	psw->buttons field.

	* window.c: Drop Root argument from RedrawOutlineAtNewPosition.
	Added `force-reset-window-frame!'. Update comment on
	`set-window-button!' since it's working a bit better, and force it
	to redraw, and simplify it a bit.

	* virtual.c, deskpage.c: Drop last arg from MoveViewport_internal,
 	MoveViewport; fix some warnings.

	* session-manager.c: Fix warning re: unused var.

	* scwm.h: Added COPY_INTEGER_WITH_DEFAULT_OR_ERROR,
	COPY_INTEGER_OR_ERROR macros -- should use these more pervasively
	for error checking.

	* scwm.c: Added --no-backtrace option; rename "nonsense" unused
	params to "ignored";  drop unused var.

	* scwm-constraints.h, scwm-constraints.cc: Drop last arg (fGrab)
 	from ChangeVirtualPosition.

	* resize.h, resize.c: Drop first arg (root) from
 	RedrawOutlineAtNewPosition.  Fix some uninit vars. Fix some doc
	strings. Fix bug: make InteractiveResize actually set its "out" parameters
	with the final width/height.

	* placement.c: Added missing return.

	* move.c: Use new RedrawOutlineAtNewPosition,
	RemoveRubberbandOutline with 1 fewer args.

	* menuitem.h, menuitem.c: Added fIsForcedSubmenu field, use it,
	print it, added submenu_p option to ctr.

	* menu.h, menu.c: Added cmsPopupDelay, cmsHoverDelay fields.
	Added setters, getters.  Drop some #if 0 code.  Fix bug in
	popup-delay not getting invoked if hover-delay was less than
	popup-delay.  Fix bug in initial menuitem not getting selected
	until a mouse move, even if it was initially under the pointer
	(thanks to Warwick Harvey for this bug report). Have
	MenuInteraction return the menu item instead of the action.
	Honour fIsForcedSubmenu when doing popups, drawing of submenu
	arrow, etc.  Drop redundant derefs of menu symbols (soon can drop
	menu symbol stuff altogether, probably).

	* icons.c: drop unused vars, minor code formatting.

	* guile-compat.c: drop unused var.

	* face.c: Added CONCEPT section for "Window Style" -- very brief
	placeholder for improvements to scwmdoc to extract the window
	style options.

	* events.c: #include <assert.h>, minor formatting, fix uninit var,
	add failure on missed switch.

	* decorations.c: drop unused code, minore formatting.

	* borders.h, borders.c: Added CLeftButtons, CRightButtons (now
	they just return Scr._nr_left/right_buttons, but they are used
	semi-appropriately and alternative untested definitions exist --
	trying to get the button decoration behaviour more reasonable).
	Do not draw a button (and unmap it) if it is suppressed -- title
	bar still doesn't cover the hole.

	* binding.c: Drop some unused vars.

	* add_window.c: #include events.h, focus.h for their
	prototypes. Drop last arg from MoveViewport_internal,
	ChangeVirtualPosition.  Fix bug in possibly calling XDeleteContext
	on None.

Wed Mar 24 19:14:06 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* color.c: Drop some #if 0 code in make-color; we perhaps should
 	make failed color creations (when palette is full, e.g.) return a
	closest-match, or have a make-closest-color that does so.  It'll
	be a pain to fix all the code that assumes make-color isn't going
	to throw.

Tue Mar 23 11:36:04 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* image.h, image.c: Use imlib if USE_IMLIB is set.  This removes
 	the load-xbm, load-xpm primitives, and replaces them with a new
 	load-imlib-image primitive. That new primitive is then the only
 	image loader registered by default.  Patch from James LewisMoss.

	* scwm.c: Call init_image() later, after the display has been
	opened, since the new optional imlib code needs the display opened
	for its initialization.  (Patch from James LewisMoss, though I
	removed the conditionals as the xbm/xpm init_image() works fine
	later, too).

1999-03-22  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* session-manager.c (setSMProperties): Add GsmPriority prop.
	(restoreWindowState): Would make most window start iconic erroneously.

Mon Mar 22 18:57:23 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* callbacks.h, callback.c: Added some extra prototypes, prepare
	for support for new hooks, but #if 0 it out.

	* scwm.c: Added back the setting of
	*suppress-old-style-hook-warning* since new hooks aren't close to
	right yet, and probably not worth supporting -- I fixed a bug in
	reset-hook! instead that was the root of my problems.

Mon Mar 22 18:39:45 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* *.[ch]: Clean up FIXGJB comments to use the new format

	* window.h, window.c, add_window.c, add_window.h: Remove
 	fWindowListSkip, fCirculateSkip, fCirculateSkipIcon as these are
 	no longer used.  Move DestroyScwmWindow, window_close_hook into
 	add_window.c.

	* util.c: Drop call_thunk_with_message_handler.

	* scwm.c: Do not use a static buffer size of 1024 for reporting
	M_FVWM_ERROR module messages-- dynamically allocate and FREE the
	buffer using the length as determined by the printing to stderr.

	* scwm-constraints.hpp: Increase the weight of stays for each
	window added.

	* scwm-constraints.h, scwm-constraints.cc: Added
	CassowaryCloseWindow.

	* resize.c, move.c: Have rubber-band-resize, opaque-resize return
 	the new size of the window instead of unspecified. Have
	rubber-band-move, opaque-move return the new viewport position of
	the window instead of unspecified.

	* move.c: Drop old version of SnapCoordsToEdges.

	* miscprocs.h: Removed (no longer refer to recapture primitive
	from C code).

	* miscprocs.c: Remove wait-for-window primitive -- it's dangerous
	and worthless.

	* guile-compat.h: Drop #define of scm_make_vector

Mon Mar 22 14:06:41 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* winprop.c, window.c, virtual.c, shutdown.c, resize.c, move.c,
	image.c, module-interface.c, icons.c, events.c, deskpage.c,
	constraint-primitives.cc, callbacks.c, add_window.c: Fix calls to
	SCWM_HOOK macro to pass the additional argument.

	* callbacks.h: Add extra arg (the # of args) to SCWM_HOOK, and use
	scm_make_named_hook if HAVE_SCM_MAKE_HOOK. (i.e., handle new style
	Guile hooks -- new == >1.3)

	* scwm.c: Do not set! the *suppress-old-style-hook-warning*
	variable as new-style hooks are now properly handled (I hope, but
	largely untested).

	* menu.c: Fix documentation bug -- do not use <keysym> in a doc
	comment as that is an sgml tag.

1999-03-21  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* window.c (s_restack_windows): Save one PSWFROMSCMWIN call.

Fri Mar 19 15:09:18 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* binding.c: Make context_strings global so it can be closer to
	its parallel array binding_contexts, and make frame-corners and
	frame-sides the preferred symbol names for those contexts
	('corners and 'border are no longer usable, but few, if any, were
	using them).  Added some docs to the Event Contexts concept, but
	they are horribly incomplete.

Fri Mar 19 08:56:12 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* add_window.c: Updated docs for the hooks.

1999-03-18  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* session-manager.c (doneSM): Check first.
	(initSM): Took registering with SM out.
	(SM-register): New scheme primitive that registers with the SM.
	(SM-client-id): Deprecated.

Thu Mar 18 10:28:04 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* events.c (HandleMapRequestKeepRaised): Restore pswCurrent's old
	value after invoking hooks.  An attempt to fix bug Robert
	B. noticed when starting a gnome-panel.

Thu Mar 18 09:05:15 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xrm.h, log-usage.c: Added include config.h

Wed Mar 17 18:37:16 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm-screen-ci.hpp, scwm-constraints.hpp,scwm-constraints.cc,
 	constraint-primitives.cc,: Include "Cl.h" and "cassowary_scm.hpp"
 	from the $prefix/include directory, instead of from the cassowary
 	build directory.

Wed Mar 17 12:47:45 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c (DeferExecution): Added two extra args to return the
 	location of the click selection.  Moved the prototype closer to
 	the beginning of the file.  Replace `select-window' primitive with
 	`select-viewport-position' primitive that returns the position of
 	the click as well as the window selected. `select-window' is now a
 	proc in base.scm.  Replace calls to select_window C primitive with
	"gh_car(select_viewport_position(..))" to just return the window.
	Remove invocations of the invalid-interaction-hook from
	DeferExecution.  Instead do that only in `get-window' if
	select-viewport-position returned #f for the window.

	* move.c: Added note to comment for Keyboard_shortcuts.

Wed Mar 17 10:45:50 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* virtual.c: Handle the EDGE_NONE case in notify_edge_enter,
	notify_edge_leave.   Remove unused vars in HandlePaging.

Wed Mar 17 10:45:16 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.h: Added list_stacking_order prototype as this is used by
	the rebordering code.

Tue Mar 16 16:38:55 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* constraint-primitives.cc, scwm-constraints.cc,
	scwm-constraints.h, scwm-constraints.hpp, scwm-screen-ci.hpp:
	Renamed cassowary calls to match revised identifier names for
	cassowary/qoca API merge.

Mon Mar 15 16:59:43 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c (SigResetLoop): Added a scwm_msg for when a reset-signal
	is received.

Fri Mar 12 14:44:33 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c: Added DecorationWidth, DecorationHeight,
	DecorationXOffset, DecorationYOffset, ClientWidth, ClientHeight
	functions, and use them instead of inline math.  Also introduce
	use of __inline__ (expands to nothing #ifndef __GNUCC__).  Improve
	docs on window-size, window-frame-size to refer to each other.

	* shutdown.c: Use new XA_SCWM_RESTARTING, and set that property to
	"scwm-restart" before restarting scwm (done before
	run_restart_command because we must do it before the X connection
	is closed).  Also replaced a use of inline with __inline__ since
	the former is a GNU CCism.

	* scwm.h: Added #define of __inline__ to nothing if needed.  Added
	XA_SCWM_RESTARTING, update other extern Atom decls.

	* scwm.c: Added XA_SCWM_RESTARTING, removed extern XA_WM_PROTOCOLS
	(already done in scwm.h).  Added SetRestartingGlobal() to check
	XA_SCWM_RESTARTING property (set just before run_restart_command).  My
	WM_DESKTOP property is set on the root window even when Scwm is
	not restarting itself, but this reliably works for me.

	* resize.c:  Convert dragWidth, dragHeight to application (client)
	window size before coverting to client units.  Improve docs of
	interactive_resize_new_size_hook.

	* move.c: Doc update to interactive_move_new_position_hook

	* ICCCM.c: Drop an Intern that's guaranteed to already be done.

	* callbacks.c: Replace inline with __inline__ to remove dependence
	on GCC.

Wed Mar 10 20:15:57 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* binding.c (s_bind_key): Replace RELEASE_PROC in documentation
	with RELEASE-PROC (_'s in function args turn into dashes in
	documentation of the primitive)

Wed Mar 10 19:58:09 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* resize.c: Fix bugs in calls of interactive_resize_new_size_hook,
	interactive_resize_start_hook.  The wrong numbers were being
	passed in.

	* constraint-primitives.cc: Updated for version >= .3 of
 	Cassowary.  Use ClVariable-s as handles instead of using pointers
 	to ClVariable.

1999-02-28  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@alum.mit.edu>

	* binding.c, binding.h: Allow release procedures with `bind-key'
	as with `bind-keycode'; provide `*-' prefix to key/mouse specs to
	indicate AnyModifier; provide some more intutitive aliases for
	several binding contexts: 'client-window, 'root-window, 'border
	and 'corners, as well as better names for the buttons,
	i.e. 'left-button-1, 'right-button-3, etc.
	* events.c: Make sure synthetic event key and mouse specs don't
	allow AnyModifier.

	* events.c: Make window-leve-hook pass the window as an argument.

1999-02-27  John Kodis  <kodis@jagunet.com>

	* events.c (HandleEnterNotify): run window-enter-hook functions.
	(HandleLeaveNotify): run window-leave-hook functions.
	(init_events): set up the window-enter- and window-leave- hooks.

1999-02-11  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@alum.mit.edu>

	* window.c: Added new primitive icon-size which takes a window and
	returns the size of the icon (including both the image and the
	icon title).

	* window.c: Fixed minor bug in `resize-to' in computation of size
	adjustment (only was broken for no-side-decoration windows). Also
	made sym_shaded and SendClientConfigurNotify have external linkage
	for the benefit of the c-animation module.

1999-02-10  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@alum.mit.edu>

	* virtual.c (GenerateEdgeEvents): New function which checks the
	pan frame state and generates appropriate invocations of
	`edge-enter-hook' and/or `edge-leave-hook'.
	(HandleEvents): Invoke `edge-scroll-hook' when edge scrolling
	happens. This hook is temporary.
	(checkPanFrames): Always leave the pan frames mapped.
	* virtual.h: prototype GenerateEdgeEvents
	* events.c, move.c, resize.c: Vall GenerateEdgeEvents as appropriate.

	* borders.c: Fix all remaining visual glitches when using
	no-side-decorations, both mwm-border and regular. (As far as I can
	tell).

1999-02-09  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@alum.mit.edu>

	* borders.c, colors.c, errors.c, window.c: Do not use
	gh_symbol2scm, instead declare appropriate sym_ variables wherever
	appropriate.
	* Makefile.am: Handle borders.x, errors.x

	* borders.c: Fix numerous visual inconsistencies when using
	`no-side-decorations'. Nearly all should be fixed, a handful
	remain in the case where both mwm-border and no-side-decorations
	are on.

	* xproperty.c (s_X_property_set_x): Deal apropriately with
	zero-length property values (D'oh!). Bug report from Sam Steingold.

1999-02-08  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@alum.mit.edu>

	* virtual.c, window.c, window.h: Abstract out notification of new
	desk for a window; notify of new window for desk when moving
	sticky windows during a desk change.

	* winprop.c, winprop.h: New files, generic window property
	handling moved here. Notification of window property changes set
	up through `window-property-change-hook'. Eventually, notification
	will be smarter and it will be possible to register for
	notification on only a specific property or only a specific
	window.

	* window.c: Add change notification for `sticky', `shaded',
	`on-top' and `desk' window properties through
	`window-property-change-hook'. Others will be added over time.

	* scwm.c: Call init_winprop()

	* Makefile.am: Handle winprop.c, winprop.h, winprop.x

1999-02-08  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@alum.mit.edu>

	* window.c (MovePswToCurrentPosition): Don't move windows that are
	sticky but off screen, the gnome panel actually wants to do that
	sometimes for some reason.

	* deskpage.c: Added `desk-size-change-hook'.
	* virtual.c: Added `viewport-position-change-hook'.

	* window.c: New hook `close-window-hook' invoked when a window
	closes for any reason.

	* events.c: Pass window (or 'root-window or #f if unrecognized)
	based on Event.xclient.window to client-message-hook.

Fri Feb  5 20:39:37 1999  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@alum.mit.edu>

        * binding.c (remove_binding): Ungrab key when removing a
        binding. Fixes some annoying bugs for me. This might trigger
        latent bugginess with respect to key bindings that exist
        separately for different contexts but I don't have time to fix
        that now (exists for mouse bindings too, it seems).

1999-01-30  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@alum.mit.edu>

	* borders.c (SetBorderX): Do not try to draw when the border width
	is zero, to avoid certain visual glitces.

	* decorations.c (SelectDecor): Correct handling of "no titlebar" hints.

	* events.c: Add `X-MapRequest-hook' - various protocols require
	updates from various hints each time the window maps.

1999-01-27  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* session-manager.c (SavePhase): New variable.
	(saveYourself): Enter phase 1.
	(saveYourself2): Go from phase 1 to phase 2 on entry, reset phase
	on exit.
	(shutdownCancelled): Cancel save if phase 2 was not reached.

Tue Jan 26 15:34:17 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* menulook.c, menu.c, ICCCM.c: Changed some doc comments.

1999-01-26  Sam Steingold  <sds@goems.com>

	* Makefile.am (noinst_HEADERS): do not use `+='.

Mon Jan 25 17:36:52 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c, window.h: Added window_pixel_size_to_client_units to
	support conversion to client units since that code is now needed
	by the resize hook as well as the `window-size' primitive (rewrote
	the latter to use it).

	* resize.c: Added args to interactive_resize_new_size_hook to
	support reporting position and client-unit sizes, as well as pixel
	sizes.

	* callbacks.c: Added scwm_safe_callN, callN_hooks for 4<=N<=7.

Mon Jan 25 10:27:31 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c (s_deiconify): Permit deiconify to be given a virtual
	position to deiconify the window to.  This permits supporting a
	deiconify-to-current-viewport function

	* icons.c: Fixed a couple of comments.

Sat Jan 23 16:35:02 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xrm.c, xproperty.c, window.c, message-window.c, menulook.c,
	menuitem.c, menu.c, image.c, face.c, decor.c, color.c,
	callbacks.c, binding.c, ICCCM.c:  Replace uses of iarg with
	literal numbers, and fixed numerous bugs of mismatching argument
	number and name.

Sat Jan 23 10:48:39 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* menu.c (PopdownMenu): Only invoked the unhover-action if the
	hover action had been invoked.

Fri Jan 22 15:52:10 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* menu.c (MenuInteraction): Added MENUSTATUS_NEWITEM_HOTKEY for
	hotkey-based newitem actions to use to differentiate between
	shortcut keys to select items and keys to just maneuver the menus

Fri Jan 22 08:52:07 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* constraint-primitives.cc (s_scwm_set_master_solver_x): Added
	trailing "!" to scwm-set-master-solver!.  Added
	`scwm-master-solver' procedure to avoid requiring access to a
	global variable from the simple-constraints module

Thu Jan 21 12:06:19 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* icons.c: Added second arg (was-iconified?) to handlers called by
 	iconify-hook and deiconify-hook.  This lets the hook act only on
	changes in iconification state (avoids an infinite loop in
	kwm-emulation by setting an iconified X property which causes
	iconification, which causes the re-setting of the property, and so
	on.

Wed Jan 20 10:45:49 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* message-window.c (s_make_message_window): Move FIXME comment out
	of doc comment so doc extract warning disappears.

Tue Jan 19 13:11:46 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* events.c:  Added X-root-PropertyNotify-hook and invoke it as
	appropriate.  This provides some missing low-level support for
	managing communication w/ kwm modules.

	* menu.c: Added fMenuHotkeysActivateItems,
 	set-menu-hotkeys-activate-item! menu-hotkeys-activate-item?
  	primitives, and honour them when handling shortcut keys during
 	menu-interaction "mode".  Permit XK_space to activate a menu item,
 	too.  Default behaviour has changed so that the keypress activates
 	the item (ala fvwm2, Win95, etc.). Thanks Juha Pohjalainen, Sam
 	Falkner for the feedback leading to this change.

Mon Jan 18 20:13:54 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ICCCM.c (s_send_client_message): Added send-client-message
	primitive to permit KWM-like (and probably gnome-like) client
	messages to be sent from the scheme level.  Added init_ICCCM()
	since this is the first primitive ICCCM exports

	* events.c (HandleClientMessage):  Add and invoked
	client_message_hook-s

	* callbacks.h, callbacks.c: Added FEmptyHook() predicate for use
	when the preparation of args for the hook is expensive

	* Makefile.am, scwm.c: Added ICCCM.x, call init_ICCCM() from
	initialization code.

	* xproperty.c (X-get-property, X-set-property!): permit atoms
	(longs) to be used for the name, instead of only allowing strings.

Mon Jan 18 13:05:21 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c, message-window.c, menu.c, constraint-primitives.cc,
 	callbacks.c: Fixed some doc warnings; correct some mistaken uses
 	of iarg++ (used in conditionals so they did not always execute)

	* binding.h: Drop field "Action" from struct Binding, add
	ReleaseThunk for the key release event

	* binding.c: (add_binding) Correct bnum_or_keysym to
	bnum_or_keycode, use release_proc too; (GrabButtons) Drop test of
	BINDING->Action since that field is now gone; (keysym_to_keycode)
	added; (bind_keycode) added -- lower level interface to key
	bindings that permits specifying release procedures;
	(mod_mask_shift, mod_mask_control) added -- these were missing and
	are needed for completeness

	* icons.c: Drop test of BINDING->Action since that field is now
 	gone

	* events.h, events.c: Added HandleKeyRelease(), generalize
	HandleKeyPress to HandleKeyEvent, drop checks of BINDING->Action
	(I eliminated that field)

Fri Jan 15 14:14:05 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* decor.c, screen.c, face.c (print_XXX): Use scwm_ptr2scm instead
	of gh_int2scm or gh_long2scm -- abstracts out the size of a
	pointer to fix problems with 64-bit machines.

	* scwm.h (scwm_ptr2scm): Added this macro to abstract out the size
	of a pointer -- for now just use long.

Fri Jan 15 10:43:21 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* menu.c (MenuInteraction): Guard derefs of pmiim in case no item
	is yet selected-- fixes bug reported by Sam Falkner whereby
	bringing up a menu via a keyboard shortcut and immediately
	pressing <Return> resulted in a core dump.  Thanks Sam!

1999-01-14  Todd Larason  <jtl@molehill.org>

	* session-manager.c (doneSM, setSMProperties): Split variable
	declaration and initialization to make non-gcc compilers happy.
	Standard C only allows constants in initialization functions.
	Thanks to Sam Falkner for the good bug reports.

Mon Jan 11 08:36:14 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c: Added newhandler_doreset(..) and SigResetLoop(..) to use
	setjmp/longjmp to make SIGHUP signals cause Scwm to revert to the
	main event loop.  A software-hung Scwm (e.g., in an infinite loop
	of scheme code) can be reset by using "kill -1
	[scwm-process-id]".  Not for ordinary use, but is incredibly handy
	in emergencies.

Mon Jan 11 22:34:52 1999  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@alum.mit.edu>

	* xrm.c: Added proper copyright notice.

Sat Jan  9 11:29:40 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.h, window.c: Use const char * for func_name arg of ensure_valid and
	convert_move_data (gives warnings on guile-1.3, but the warnings
	are guile's fault, not ours).  Also rename subr, func to
	"func_name" to make more clear the argument is for error messages

Wed Jan  6 07:59:03 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c (scwm_main): Added missing parenthesis inside an
	evaluated string #ifdef HAVE_SCM_MAKE_HOOK.  Thanks Shuji Narazaki!

1999-01-05  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* add_window.c: Forgot to check for SM before including
	session-manager.h. Thanks to Stephen Tell <tell@cs.unc.edu> for
	the report.

Sun Dec 27 13:55:09 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* placement.c, placement.h, add_window.c: Unify desk selection
 	with window placement, so windows starting on other desks will not
 	necessarily trigger a desk switch. Expose the default desk
 	selection algorithm (which does still always switch) as
 	`place-on-default-desk'. This area probably needs more work later.

	* guile-compat.c (scm_internal_cwdr_no_unwind): Temporarily add
 	this version of scm_internal_cwdr which does not unwind existing
 	winders.
	* callbacks.c: Use scm_internal_cwdr_no_unwind in place of
 	scm_internal_cwdr throughout. This allows `dynamic-wind's to
 	safely be wrapped around calls to primitives that make callbacks
 	or invoke hooks.

Mon Dec 21 07:32:28 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* icons.c (AutoPlace): Stop treating sticky windows differently
 	for purposes of icon placement. I'm not sure what the old code was
 	trying to do, but what it was actually ending up doing was
 	definitely wrong. Thanks to Arturo Perez for reporting this bug
 	and Albert L. Ting for clarifying the problem.

Sat Dec 12 00:09:50 1998  Carl R. Witty  <cwitty@newtonlabs.com>

	* color.c (Shadow and Highlight Factors): New concept doc.

	* Grab.c (s_X_ungrab_server): Rewrite doc.

	* xproperty.c (s_X_property_set_x): Rewrite doc.

	* window.c (s_window_deletable_p): Rewrite doc.
	(s_window_shade): Typo fix in doc.
	(s_window_size_hints): Typo fix in doc.

	* miscprocs.c (s_wait_for_window): Update doc.

	* window.c (s_set_window_context_x): Rewrite doc.
	(s_get_window): Rewrite doc.

	* color.c (s_set_hilight_foreground_x, s_hilight_foreground,
 	s_set_hilight_background_x, s_hilight_background): Rewrite docs.

	* face.c (s_set_face_flag_x): Update doc.

	* scwm.c (scwm_main): Typo fix in comment.

	* window.c (s_window_property): Typo fix in doc.

	* deskpage.c (s_set_edge_move_threshold_x): Rewrite doc.

	* window.h, window.c, resize.c, borders.c, add_window.c: Eliminate
 	the fMaximized window flag.  (Nothing ever set this flag to True.)

	* placement.c (s_smart_place_window, s_clever_place_window,
 	s_random_place_window, s_default_placement_proc): Update docs
 	(basically, add cross-referencing).
	(PlaceWindow): Add FIXME comment.

1998-12-13  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* Makefile.am (guile_snarfs): Snarf "session-manager.c".

	* session-manager.c (SMerror): New static variable.
	(restoreWindowState): Do nothing if SM is not active.
	(SM-client-id): New primitive.
	(SM-error-message): New primitive.
	(initSM): Include snarfed stuff.
	Don't emit warning, save it in SMerror.

	* shutdown.c: Properly include "session-manager.h".

1998-12-10  Sam Steingold  <sds@goems.com>

	* scwm.c:499: fixed #ifdef capitalization.

Sun Dec  6 02:50:53 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* scwm.c (scwm_main): Make sure to supress guile hooks on
 	old-style hooks from newer post-1.3 snapshots.

	* window.c (un_keep_on_top): Call KeepOnTop after changing the
 	flag, in case this window was on top of other kept-on-top windows.

	* events.c (HandleVisibilityNotify): Remove the body of this
 	function except the debugging message. Raising kept-on-top windows
 	on VisibilityNotify events is not helpful, and it caused an
 	annoying problem with menus which was reported by Craig Struble

Sat Dec  5 18:34:53 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* window.c (FocusOn): Do not attempt to snap to the window's
 	viewport position, change to its desk, or move it. There are
 	separate primitives to do all those.

	* message-window.c, message-window.h: add shadow_color and
 	hilight_color fields to the message_window structure, and
 	preallocate these when setting the background color, so we don't
 	crash on interactive moves if the colors can't be allocated.

	* message-window.c (init_message_window): #include
 	"message-window.x", not "msgwin.x".

Sat Dec  5 12:27:43 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* borders.c: Fix bug whereby GET_DECOR was assumed to return an
	image;  it can return #f, which was causing a seg fault when
	trying to dereference #f to get the IMAGE object (triggered by
	sds.scwmrc when images are missing).

	* resize.c: Remove unused fOpaque variable in rubber_band_resize.

	* events.c: #include virtual.h for prototype of raisePanFrames()


Sat Dec  5 11:51:45 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* message-window object support -- implemented by Jeff W. Nichols

	* message-window.c, message-window.h: Added -- code from move.c,
	resize.c that now supports multiple message-windows objects as SMOBs

	* window.c: Rename select-window-interactively to
	select-window-interactively-no-message since message-windows are
	now more at the scheme level.  select-window-interactively is
	defined in base.scm, now.  Clean up `convert_move_data' -- it had
	unused variables and an error message that was unneeded.

	* scwm.c: Added MsgWindowContext and ExposeWindowProcContext for
	message-window support and generalized expose procedures. Call
	init_message_window, and eliminate the global message window (that
	support is at the scheme level now).

	* screen.h: Drop the MsgWindow field of struct ScreenInfo -- they
	are first class scheme objects now.

	* resize.h, resize.c: Elimnate CreateMessageWindow,
	set-message-window-attributes!, set-message-window-position!,
	display-message!, message-window-mapped?, DisplaySize.  Drop
	C-level support for displaying resize sizes.  Be sure to call
	new-size-hook once at the beginning of resizes (after start-resize
	hook)

	* move.h, move.c: Eliminate DisplayMessage, MapMessageWindow,
	UnmapMessageWindow, DisplayPosition.  Generalized code is now in
	message-window.c

	* menu.c: Move "global" vars back into scheme module with
	pre-define-module hack to avoid initialization order dependencies
	(thanks Craig Struble!)

	* icons.c: Added FIXME comment

	* events.h, events.c: Added ExposeWindowProcContex extern, ExposeProc
	typedef for generalized expose event handling to support
	re-drawing message window objects.  Use the expose proc in
	HandleExpose if one is attached to the window.

	* Makefile.am: Added message-window.c, .x, .h

	* window.h: Added prototype for convert_move_data

	* xproperty.c (X_property_delete_x): Remove unused local var, "value"

1998-12-04  Todd Larason  <jtl@molehill.org>

	* add_window.c: grammar fix

	* binding.c: documentation clarification

	* callbacks.c: grammar fix in documentation

	* color.c: doc fixes

	* decor.c: code simplification, merge InitScwmDecor into decor2scm

	* events.c: minor doc fix

	* deskpage.c: doc fix, standardize on 'virtual coordinate' and
	'viewport coordinate'

	* face.c: fix typo in comment

	* font.c: grammar fix to documentation

	* icons.c: remove an obsolete comment, mark another as probably
	obsolete

	* image.c: minor doc fixes

	* miscprocs.c: doc fixes, change name of argument to
	set-click-delay! from usec to msec to reflect actual resolution

	* move.c: doc fix

	* placement.c: doc fixes, information on placement procedures

	* window.c: lots of doc fixes

	* xproperty.c: "It's a window system named X, not a system named X
	Windows"

	All of the above are from Carl R. Witty <cwitty@newtonlabs.com>
	Thanks much!

Fri Dec  4 21:57:39 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* menu.c: Gross hack alert - temporarily declare some variables
 	from C to avoid the nasty "before the module declaration"
 	trick. This should be fixed when we have a sounder plan for
 	dynamic menu styles.

	* scwm.c (scwm_main): Initialize menulook and drawmenu functions
 	before menu, so the latter can initialize a Scheme variable to
 	drawmenu_menu_look.

Thu Dec  3 01:43:49 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* move.c (interactive_move, rubber_band_move, opaque_move):
 	`interactive-move' removed from here and replaced with
 	`rubber-band-move' and `opaque-move'.

	* resize.c (interactive_resize, rubber_band_resize,
 	opaque_resize): `interactive-resize' removed from here and
 	replaced with `rubber-band-resize' and `opaque-resize'.

1998-12-03  Todd Larason  <jtl@molehill.org>

	* scwm.c (scwm_main): call init_icons() to initialize the icon hooks

	* menulook.c: documentation additions from Carl Witty - Thanks Carl!

	* menuitem.c: documentation fixes from Carl Witty

	* menu.c (PmdPrepopFromPmiim): If the action for a menu item is
	not a popup menu, but the hover trigger is, popup that menu
	(InitializeMenuItemInMenu): draw the popup arrow if either action
	or hover is a menu

	* icons.c: add iconify_hook and deiconify_hook, call them in the
	obvious places
	(init_icons): new function, to initialize the new hooks

	* Makefile.am (guile_snarfs): add 'icons.x'

Thu Dec  3 01:43:49 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* xproperty.c (X_property_delete_x): Added new primitive
 	(X-property-delete! WIN NAME) to go with the others.

1998-11-30  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* move.c (moveLoop): Restore original position when bailing out.

	* resize.c (InteractiveResize): Restore original size/position when
	bailing out.

	* add_window.c (AddWindow): psw->fTitle may already be 0 through
	SM, handle that.

Tue Nov 24 08:17:06 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c (s_get_window_context): Add FIXME note regarding the
	acceptable doc-extraction warning (window_context cannot be the C
	name of the window-context function because it is a variable)

1998-11-24  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* borders.c, events.c, scwm.c, scwm.h, xproperty.c: Changed all
	occurances of Boolean to Bool to avoid future confusion.

Mon Nov 23 17:33:51 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* move.c (moveLoop): Added a couple of casts to round reals to
	integers, and use unsigned int instead of int;  all changes that
	quiet warnings for me.

Sat Nov 21 14:45:43 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* move.c (moveLoop): Use gh_int2scm in calling the
	interactive_move_new_position_hook so scheme objects are passed;
	the raw integers were being passed before in error.

1998-11-21  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* borders.c (SetupFrame): Add a little bit more padding to the
	right end of squashed titlebars.

	* session-manager.c (writeWindow): Clamp title_height to 0 if
	!fTitle.

Fri Nov 20 02:18:26 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* scwm.c: Make some `static' functions have extern linkage so the
 	scwmgtkhelper module can get at them.

Tue Nov 17 18:03:44 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Grab.c, add_window.c, borders.c, constraint-primitives.cc,
 	drawmenu.c, events.c, face.c, icons.c, image.c, log-usage.c,
 	menu.c, resize.c, scwm-constraints.cc, scwm-constraints.hpp,
 	scwm.c, session-manager.c, window.c: Eliminate use of the
 	gcc-specific __FUNCTION__ construct.

Mon Nov 16 17:41:54 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* resize.c (set_message_window_attributes_x): Allocate shadow and
 	hilight colors here.

	move.c:(DisplayMessage): Don't allocate them here.

	* screen.h: Add msg_window_hilite and msg_window_shadow fields.
	screen.c: Protect them.
	scwm.c: Initialize them.

	* Makefile.am: Make sure all headers are in noinst_HEADERS; put
 	generate_scm_init_funcs in EXTRA_DIST.

1998-11-16  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* add_window.c: Forgot to include "session-manager.h".
	(AddWindow): StartDesk handling moved after `restoreWindowState'
	call.

	* session-manager.c (writeWindow, readWindow): Save/load icon
	position.
	(restoreWindowState): Restore icon position.
	Restoring of desk nr and iconification now really works.

1998-11-15  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* session-manager.c (getWindowClientId): wmhints may be NULL.

Sun Nov 15 00:48:48 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* scwm-constraints.h: Fix bogus parenthesization in definitions of
 	FRAME_X_VIRT and FRAME_Y_VIRT.

	* shutdown.c: Pass restarted? boolean argument to shutdown hooks;
 	do not switch to viewport 0,0.

	* scwm.c (RestoreWithdrawnLocation): Do not attempt to move
 	windows to the current viewport, ever. This can be done in a
 	shutdown hook.

	(Reborder): Release the windows in the reverse of the stacking
 	order. This way, the windows do not change stacking order when you
 	restart scwm, or exit it and run it again.

Sat Nov 14 14:50:06 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* window.c (restack_windows): Make restack_windows not lose on an
 	empty list.

Fri Nov 13 15:03:15 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.h (SCWM_NEWCELL_SMOB): Remove extraneous trailing
	semi-colon in macro definition

1998-11-12  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* move.c (moveLoop): Values for DisplayPosition now take into account
	that the window could be iconified.

Tue Nov 10 10:48:38 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.h (REGISTER_SCWMSMOBFUNS): Protect REGISTER_SCWMSMOBFUNS
	macro with do { .. } while (0)

Tue Nov 10 10:47:19 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* menulook.c (s_copy_menu_look): Rename original_menulook to
	original_menu_look so it matches the docstring ORIGINAL-MENU-LOOK

Tue Nov 10 10:16:05 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* events.c (HandleMapRequestKeepRaised): Call raisePanFrames to
	try to fix the long-standing fvwm2 bug regarding the virtual
	panning windows at screen edges sporadically not working when a
	netscape communicator window is at the edge of the screen.  Thanks
	Hideki Sakurada.

1998-11-09  Robert Bihlmeyer  <e9426626@stud2.tuwien.ac.at>

	* session-manager.c (STATE_FILE_SERIAL): New macro.
	(saveYourself2): Put it at the beginning of the state file.
	(loadMyself): Ignore state files with different serial.
	Use __FUNCTION__ instead of FUNC_NAME in all places.

	* window.c (FlagsBitsFromSw): Two typos fixed.
	(PswUpdateFlags): New function, inverse of `FlagsBitsFromSw'.
	* window.h: Prototype it.
	* session-manager.c: Use these functions to save/restore various
	window flags. Also save the desk nr - restoring it does not yet
	work.

	* resize.c (InteractiveResize): Display FRAME_WIDTH/FRAME_HEIGHT
	in message window, as `FXGetWindowSize' returns wrong values in
	rubberband mode.

	* move.c (moveLoop): Display FRAME_X_VP/FRAME_Y_VP in message
	window, as `FXGetWindowTopLeft' returns wrong valuse in rubberband
	mode.

	* window.c (compare_focus_time): New function.
	(list-focus-order): Did not work. Reimplemented.

Sat Nov  7 15:41:21 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* decor.c (set_window_decor_x): Use SetBorderX instead of
 	SetBorder to guarantee redraw.

1998-11-02  Robert Bihlmeyer  <e9426626@stud2.tuwien.ac.at>

	* session-manager.h (XA_WM_CLIENT_LEADER): New variable.

	* session-manager.c (initSM): Initialize it.
	(hton32, ntoh32): Removed.
	(writeI32, readI32): Use `ntohl' and `htonl' instead.
	(readI32): Return 0 on EOF.
	(getWindowClientId): New function.
	(writeWindow): Use it.
	Write out width/height of client window instead of frame.
	(readWindow): Return NULL on EOF.
	(restoreWindowState): Actually implemented.
	(loadMyself): Would load only the first record.

	* add_window.c (AddWindow): Call to `restoreWindowState' moved up.

	* menu.c (print_menu): But using SAFE_MENUITEM is wasteful, use
	MENUITEM_P instead.

Tue Oct 27 22:59:31 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* window.c: Remove optional arguments for animation and/or moving
 	pointer from move-window, window-shade, un-window-shade; rename
 	un-window-shade to window-unshade; remove set-animation! and
 	extern declarations assorted variables holding animation
 	parameters. Add convert_move_data which abstracts converting the
 	arguments passed into a move into a form usable by C, with error
 	checking, so animated-move-window can reuse this code; make
 	move-window use it.

	* move.c, move.h: Remove prototypes and declarations for
 	AnimatedMoveWindow, AnimatedShadeWindow, and assorted variables
 	holding animation parameters.

Tue Nov 10 10:48:38 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.h (REGISTER_SCWMSMOBFUNS): Protect REGISTER_SCWMSMOBFUNS

	menu with no title

1998-10-27  Robert Bihlmeyer  <e9426626@stud2.tuwien.ac.at>

	* add_window.c (AddWindow): Call `restoreWindowState'. I hope this
	is the right location to do it.

	* session-manager.c: Legalese added.
	(hton32): New macro, puts 32-bit-quantity into network byte order.
	(ntoh32): New macro, inverse to `hton32'.
	(SMWindowData): New type.
	(SMData): New variable.
	(writeI32, readI32, writeString, readString, writeWindow,
	readWindow, statefile, loadMyself): New functions.
	(saveYourself2): Renamed from `saveYourselfPhase2Proc'. Actually
	save to the state file.
	(saveYourself, shutdownCancelled, saveComplet, die): Removed
	redundant `Proc' suffix from the name.
	(setSMProperties): Don't shorten SmProgram.
	Add new SmCurrentDirectory so that restart/clone can actually
	work.
	Add new SmDiscardCommand that removes state file.
	(initSM): Initialize XA_SM_CLIENT_ID.
	Call `loadMyself' if we were reincarnated.
	(restoreWindowState): New function. Yet empty.
	* session-manager.h: Prototype it.
	(XA_SM_CLIENT_ID): New variable.

	* xproperty.c (X-property-set!): assert(0) impossible case.
	Give up on error.
	(X-property-get): Return #f in impossible case.

	* xproperty.c (GetXProperty): New function.
	(X-property-get): Use it.
	* xproperty.h: Prototype it.

	* scwm.c (InitUserData): Initialize user, home to NULL.

	* events.c (NextScwmEvent): Remove debug message.

	* system.c (xgetcwd): New function.
	* system.h: Prototype it.

	* session-manager.c (doneSM): Do nothing unless we're connected.
	Would segfault because `SmcSetProperties' needs SmcProp**, not
 	SmProp*. The segfault was catched and `doneSM' was called again
 	... nasty!

1998-10-24  Robert Bihlmeyer  <e9426626@stud2.tuwien.ac.at>

	* scwm.c: Move `main_prog_t' from here ...
	* guile-compat.h: ... to here.

	* window.c (get-window-focus): New primitive.

	* Makefile.am (noinst_HEADERS): Removed a nother reference to
	mwmcom.h that I missed before.

Thu Oct 22 14:23:44 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* scwm.c: Remove scwm_gh_enter and scwm_gh_launch_pad defintions.

	guile-compat.c, guile-compat.h: Move them here; if guile has
 	scm_load_startup_files, do not actually define them, just #define
 	scwm_gh_enter as gh_enter.

Thu Oct 22 05:43:45 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* color.h: Fix a bunch of color validation/access macros; add
 	VALIDATE_COLOR_OR_UNDEFINED.

1998-10-22  Robert Bihlmeyer  <e9426626@stud2.tuwien.ac.at>

	* decorations.c: Remove reference to unused mwmcom.h.

	access to UserName and UserHome, respectively.

1998-10-19  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* scwm.h (CLIENT_ID_STRING): Split into two versions:
	CLIENT_ID_STRING (without dashes), CLIENT_ID_OPT_STRING (prefixed
	with two dashes).

	* session-manager.c (setSMProperties): Don't copy old client-id
	options from g_argv into RestartCommand/CloneCommand. Added a
	RestartStyleHint. Program property now contains only the basename.
	Use CLIENT_ID_OPT_STRING where appropriate. SmcSetProperties used
	"&props" which was plain wrong - use "props" instead.

1998-10-18  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* menu.c (s_make_menu): validate image items with
	IMAGE_OR_SYMBOL_P instead of IMAGE_P

	* image.h: added DYNAMIC_IMAGE_P, IMAGE_OR_SYMBOL_P and
	DYNAMIC_SAFE_IMAGE

	* drawmenu.c (PaintMenuItem, PaintDynamicMenu,
	ConstructDynamicMenu): use DYNAMIC_SAFE_IMAGE instead of SAFE_IMAGE

1998-10-17  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* menulook.c (s_copy_menu_look): add doc string

	* menu.c (SzFirstItemFromPmd): include only if SCWM_DEBUG_MSGS is
	set
	(PmiimFromPmdShortcutKeypress): #if 0 - this isn't used right now
	(MenuInteraction): added a griping comment about an earlier
	change; more thought needs to go into abstracting menu feel, in
	addition to menu look

1998-10-16  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* menu.h: remove unused PfnConstructDynamicMenu typedef

	* drawmenu.c (ConstructDynamicMenu): remove pmd->{x,y}
	initialization; neither needed nor appropriate here

	* draw-pie-menu.c: removed; moved to modules/pie-menu

	* Makefile.am: remove commented-out pie-menu references

Thu Oct 15 08:04:47 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* add_window.c (AddWindow): Set psw->fl before calling
	before_new_window_hook so that psw is in a valid state for GC
	while the code runs.  Thanks Lieven Marchand for backtrace!

1998-10-15  Robert Bihlmeyer  <e9426626@stud2.tuwien.ac.at>

	* session-manager.c (setSMProperties): Include all normal options
	and updated --client-id in RestartCommand.
	userID now comes from global UserName.
	(initSM): Use SmcId/SmcNewId instead of old
	oldSessionId/newSessionId.

	* session-manager.h: Use *_IMPLEMENTATION scheme.
	Removed oldSessionId, newSessionId, sessionProg.
	(SmcId): New variable - set by --client-id option.

	* scwm.h (CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_ID_STRING): New constants.
	(UserName, UserHome): New variables.

	two.
	(main): Call it.
	(scwm_main): New option '--client-id' for session management.
	Handle it, update usage message and inline docs.

	* scwm.h, scwm.c: Use *_IMPLEMENTATION scheme.

	* events.c (NextScwmEvent): Change #ifdef from SM to
	HAVE_LIBSM_LIBICE which is used everywhere else.

Sun Oct 11 17:13:58 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c (RestoreWithdrawnLocation): If
 	scwm-no-move-windows-on-exit is defined and not #f, then don't
 	position all windows to be in the current viewport when exiting.
  	This makes windows stay where they were if you restart scwm right
 	away.  To do this better, we could store a "scwm-position"
 	property with each window so that we could move all the windows
 	onto the viewport when exiting, and if scwm is the window manager
 	that restarts, it could know to move them back to where they were
 	before the exit.

Sun Oct 11 16:29:34 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* move.c (DisplayMessage): Fail more gracefully if cannot
	allocate colors for the display message window.  Fall back to

Sat Oct 10 10:30:19 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* virtual.c (init_virtual): Added change-desk-hook, and call it
	with the new and old desks when the desktop changes

	* scwm.c: Invoke init_virtual() to add the change-desk-hook var.

	* events.c: Added window-focus-change-hook, and call it when the
	focus changes (for auto-raise, e.g.)
Thu Oct  8 12:42:25 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* resize.c (s_set_message_window_position_x): Document X-ALIGN and
	Y-ALIGN.

	* menulook.c (menulook?) : Document the proc.  (copy_menu_look)
 	Remove dummy variable, add some braces for readability, warning
	elimination.

	* menu.c: Permit SCM_BOOL_F menuitems w/o giving Bad menu item
	warning.  Fix some doc strings to have ending periods for synopsis
	sentence.  Added prototype for ConstructDynamicMenu (instead of
	#includeing "drawmenu.h"

	* drawmenu.c: Document scwm-menu-look variable.

	* constraint-primitives.cc: Use PswFromClvPv instead of a
	static_cast to get at the windows in cl_windows_of_constraint

	* color.c: Fix mis-edit in not renaming FUNC_NAME macro of
	not_menu_background.  Should these "not_menu..." things get
	obliterated or do we still rely on them somewhere?  Todd says: yes
	we use them for icon and window backgrounds and borders -- they
	need to get their colors from somewhere else before the code can
	be killed

1998-10-07  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* menu.h: scmMenuTag added to Menu; pmiimTitle added to DynamicMenu

	* menu.c: menu title support; not yet used by any menulook.
	(MenuInteraction): don't unselect/popdown when the pointer moves
	off of all menus; something like this is needed for shaped menus,
	where there may be root window showing between the two menus of a
	popup pair, and doesn't seem too bad for other cases.

	* drawmenu.c (PaintMenuItem): don't move text over by an extra
	MENU_ITEM_PICTURE_EXTRA_HORIZ_SPACE - this space should only be
	given if a side image exists, and it's already included in
	cpixLeftPicWidth
	(ConstructDynamicMenu): don't add an extra MENU_ITEM_RR_SPACE to
	pmd->cpixWidth - the space for the left is already taken into account.

1998-10-06  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* draw-xpm-menu.c: moved to modules/xpm-menus

	* scwm.c (InitVariables): menu_font removed; MenuColors renamed
	NotMenuColors
	(scwm_main): init_draw_xpm_menu removed
	(scwm_main): MenuColors renamed NotMenuColors
	(init_scwm_load_path): SCWM_BIN_LOAD_PATH added to %load-path

	* screen.h: MenuColors renamed NotMenuColors; MenuRelief renamed
	NotMenuRelief; MenuStippleColors removed

	* screen.c (mark_screen): menu_font and menu_look removed

	* menulook.h: MENULOOK_OR_SYMBOL_P, DYNAMIC_MENULOOK_P and
	DYNAMIC_SAFE_MENULOOK added

	* menulook.c (make_menulook_internal): new, most of the
	functionality of the old make_menulook
	(s_set_menu_look): removed
	(make_menulook): use make_menulook_internal
	(s_copy_menu_look): new function; copies the vtable from an
	existing menulook, with a new name and possibly new extra list

	* menu.c (s_make_menu): arguments reordered, and bg_color,
	text_color, stipple_color and font made mandatory; picture-align
	argument renamed side-picture-align; scmMenuLook set to SCM_BOOL_F
	instead of Scr.menu_look - the normal scwm look will be used
	unless it's set explictely;
	(s_set_menu_menu_look_x): new
	(NewDynamicMenu): allow scmMenuLook to be a symbol or an object,
	or invalid; if invalid, use ConstructDynamicMenu to get the normal
	scwm look

	* icons.c (CreateIconWindow): MenuColors renamed NotMenuColors;
	being used here as background and border colors for icons

	* font.c: protected_fonts removed; the icon font is protected
	through the Scr structure, and the menu font is gone;
	set-menu-font! and menu-font removed

	* drawmenu.c (PscwmFontForMenuItem): use scmFixedFont as a
	last-ditch default font, instead of Scr.MenuFont
	(init_drawmenu): no longer set Scr.menu_look; each menu has a
	menulook setting, and the standard ConstructDynamicMenu is
	explicitely used if the per-menu setting isn't valid

	* color.c: reset_menu_relief and calls to it removed; the menuing
	code handles its own relief creation;
	{set-,}menu-{foreground,background} renamed
	{set-,}not-menu-{foreground,background};
	Menu{Colors,Relief} renamed NotMenu{Colors,Relief};
	MenuStippleColors and {set-,}menu-stipple-colors removed;
	protected_colors shortened (it should probably be removed)

	* add_window.c (AddWindow): Menu{Colors,Relief} renamed
	NotMenu{Colors,Relief}; they're being used here for window text,
	shadow, relief and background colors

	* Makefile.am: draw-xpm-menu.[cx] removed; @x_ldflags@ moved from
	_LDADD to _LDFLAGS; scwm_LDFLAGS includes -export-dynamic;
	SCWM_BIN_LOAD_PATH added to scwmpaths.h

1998-10-05  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* move.c (moveLoop): call the interactive-move-new-position hook
	with properly schemified arguments

Mon Oct  5 12:25:21 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c: Added KeyReleaseMask to the event mask used on the root
	and NoFocusWin windows

	* menu.c: Added KeyReleaseMask to the mask used in getting events
	from a menu;  Permit XK_Tab to be used for advancing to the next
	menu item, and set fPermitAltReleaseToSelect when it is so used.
	Watch for KeyRelease events, and let Meta/Alt releases select the
	current item if fPermitAltReleaseToSelect is true.  Changes
	largely inspired by patch from Paul Sheer.

	* focus.c (SetFocus): Set ttLastFocussed when a window receives
	the focus.

	* add_window.c (AddWindow): Init ttLastFocussed to current time
	when a window is added.

	* window.h: Added ttLastFocussed field to ScwmWindow

	* window.c: Added `window-last-focus-time', `list-focus-order'
	(latter from Paul Sheer)

	* callbacks.c: struct cwssdr_data's handler field is now a
	scm_catch_handler_t, not an SCM (eliminates warnings)

Mon Oct  5 09:02:26 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c, image.c, font.c, color.c: Use gh_make_vector instead
 	of scm_make_vector

	* menu.c: Eliminate warning about unused variable that is used in
 	debug-only code. Fix assignment to pmenu->scmFont that immediately
 	got undone -- now makes the default font object for menus be
 	Scr.menu_font instead of SCM_UNDEFINED or SCM_BOOL_F

	* move.c: Minor indentation change

	* draw-xpm-menu.c: Fix the header to say "By Todd Larason" -- had
	the old header from my menuing code (via copy and use).

	* guile-compat.h: Added comment about scm_make_vector
	HAVE_SCM_MAKE_VECTOR_3_ARGS not being needed any longer

Fri Oct  2 15:31:38 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* menu.c (MenuInteraction): Use pmd->pmdv... not pmiim->pmd (pmiim
	  is NULL at start of this fn)

	* drawmenu.c (SetPopupMenuPositionFromMenuItem): Comment out
	  unused var pmdiNew (eliminates warning)

	* drawxpm-menu.c: #include "drawmmenu.h", add return type to
	  InitGCs(), add parens to disambiguate && and || in same
	  expression, and comment out unused var pmdiNew (all to eliminate
	  warnings)

1998-10-01  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* menu.c (menu_properties): added scmSideAlign and removed for
	now scmMenuLook
	(make_menu): removed menu-look from the documentation for now

Thu Oct  1 04:51:55 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* callbacks.c: Use scm_internal_stack_catch instead of
 	scm_internal_lazy_catch to effectively roll our own. This will
 	have worse performance bu works around the bug/limitation in
 	scm_internal_cwdr which causes occasional crashes with the
 	previous version.

1998-10-01  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* scwm.c (scwm_main): init_menulook, init_drawmenu and
	init_draw_xpm_menu added; drawmenu_init_gcs removed

	* screen.h: menu_look added to Screen struct

	* screen.c (mark_screen): mark menu_look object

	* menulook.c,menulook.h: New files, for a new 'menulook' type,
	encapsulates menu look & feel.  set-menu-look! primitive for
	settingi current menu look

	* menuitem.h (MenuItemInMenu_tag): menulook-specific
	MenuItemDrawingInfo pointer added; scwm-style information moved to
	drawmenu.c's MenuItemDrawingInfo struct

	* menu.h: all the menu drawing specific information removed.
	scmStippleColor and scmMenuLook added; MenuDrawingVtable added to
	DynamicMenu struct; window, location and size moved from
	MenuDrawingInfo struct to DynamicMenu struct

	* menu.c: include "menulook.h" instead of "drawmenu.h".
	scmStippleColor and scmMenuLook menu attributes added.
	drawing-style specific code modularized through the menulook
	type.  MIS_Grayed menu item status supported.

	* drawmenu.h: drawmenu_init_gcs and no longer correct comment removed

	* drawmenu.c: modularized, more separated from menu.c.  defines
	all the drawing structures and creates `scwm-menu-look' to
	represent this menu look.  drawmenu_init_gcs removed.

	* Makefile.am: draw-xpm-menu[cx], menulook.[ch], drawmenu.x added

Tue Sep 29 11:18:25 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xmisc.h: Fix name of prototype for SetGCBg (was SetGCFb)

	* scwm.c: #include "drawmenu.h" for drawmenu_init_gcs fn

	* resize.c, move.c: Use actual size/position of window for the
	  message display (in case the solver doesn't permit the suggested
	  resize/move).

	* color.c: Remove some unused variables to eliminate warnings.

1998-09-27  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* draw-pie-menu.c: Lots of changes to bring it up to date with the
	current drawmenu.c, and to fix bugs with the larger spacing; the
	'real' spacing works out nicely to avoid some work.  This still
	doesn't actually do pies, and still isn't used at all, but this is
	a better starting place for additional work than the previous
	version.

	* drawmenu.c (PaintSideImage): Align the side image properly if it
	completely fits and it's bottom aligned.
	(ConstructDynamicMenu): enable background images

1998-09-26  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* drawmenu.c (MakeGCs): only recompute the relief and shadow
	colors if the background color or the highlight/shadow factors
	have changed since the last menu display

	* scwm.c (scwm_main): renamed menu_init_gcs to drawmenu_init_gcs

	* screen.h: remove menu GCs

	* menu.h: move scmSideAlign up with the other side image items;
	remove menu_init_gcs

	* menu.c (s_make_menu): correct small mistake in make-menu
	documentation.  remove menu_init_gcs (now in drawmenu.c as
	drawmenu_init_gcs)

	* icons.c (DrawIconWindow): Don't use the MenuGC; still uses the
	MenuColors though, which it shouldn't.

	* generate_scm_init_funcs: allow multiple '-'s in file names

	* font.c (s_menu_font): don't bother updating the menu GC font;
	the drawmenu code does it anyway

	* drawmenu.h: drawmenu_init_gcs added

	* drawmenu.c: moved all the Menu GCs from the Scr structure to
	here, and regularized how they're set up;  moved menu_init_gcs
	here ad drawmenu_init_gcs

	* color.h: Added adjust_pixel_brightness, menu_hilight_factor_val
	and menu_shadow_factor_val

	* color.c: Added adjust_pixel_brightness; like adjust_brightness,
	but works on X Pixels not SCM color objects.  Made
	menu_hilight_factor_val and menu_shadow_factor_val external.
	Removed all references to the menu GCs.

Sat Sep 26 20:33:07 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm-constraints.hpp: Make max/min size constraints take
	decoration sizes into account (since the client specifies sizes
	for the client window, and the constraints are on the frame
	size).  Still not perfect since the decoration sizes aren't
	exposed as constraint variables, but this is an improvement.

1998-09-24  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* Grab.c, ICCCM.c, add_window.c, binding.c, borders.c,
	callbacks.c, color.c, colormaps.c, colors.c, complex.c, decor.c,
	decorations.c, deskpage.c, drawmenu.c, errors.c, events.c, face.c,
	guile-compat.c, icons.c, image.c, log-usage.c, menu.c, menuitem.c,
	miscprocs.c, module-interface.c, move.c, placement.c, resize.c,
	screen.c, scwm.c, session-manager.c, shutdown.c, string_token.c,
	syscompat.c, system.c, util.c, virtual.c, window.c, xmisc.c,
	xproperty.c, xrm.c: All headers are now #included in the following
	order: config.h, system headers, X headers, guile headers,
	<module>.h, other scwm headers, dmalloc.h.  Every module includes
	its corresponding .h file.

	* binding.h, borders.h, color.h, colors.h, decor.h, decorations.h,
	face.h, font.h, image.h, menu.h, menuitem.h, move.h, resize.h,
	screen.h, scwm.h, virtual.h, window.h, xmisc.h: header files in
	the order given above, and headers added to allow scwm headers to
	be included independantly of one another.

	* window.h, window_fwd.h: typedef struct ScwmWindow ScwmWindow in
	window_fwd.h; guard typedef in window.h against window_fwd.h's.

	* add_window.h, binding.h, colormaps.h, move.h, xmisc.h: remove #define
 	ScwmWindow mechanism for using window_fwd.h; now all handled by
 	window.h and window_fwd.h

Thu Sep 24 12:03:45 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* move.c (InteractiveMove): Reset have_orig_position after testing
	it. Thanks Hideki Sakurada!

	* add_window.c: Fix docs for before-new-window-hook, since that is
	now *not* used for window-styles (but I left the hook in in case
	there are other generally useful things to do at that phase of
	window setup -- might get removed later).

1998-09-24  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* decor.c: properly add extra height to title bars when a decor is
	attached to a window

	* add_window.c, color.c, decor.c, font.c, image.c, menu.c,
	placement.c, screen.c: Standardize header_IMPLEMENTATION and
	<config.h> location

Wed Sep 23 16:53:18 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* add_window.c: Added a before-place-new-window-hook for the
	window style to use, and call that hook before calling
	PlaceWindow.  Fixes placement off by 6 pixels (or so, depending on
	border width) bug

	* placement.c: Separate out some debugging code for ease of
	interrogation under gdb

	* decorations.c: Use -- instead of long-winded decrement

1998-09-23  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* window.c (s_set_border_width_x): Save old gravity adjustment
	before changing border width; the resize adjustment wasn't taking
	gravity into account

	* decor.c (s_set_window_decor_x): use
	set_window_internal_title_height to resize titlebar, not ResizeTo;
	this fixes the shrinking-xterm-on-restart problem for me, and
	looks like the right thing to do

Wed Sep 23 11:03:41 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c: (GrabEm) only try the XGrabPointer 5 times instead of
	1000.

	* placement.c: Use FXGetWindowTopLeft to initialize the orig_x,
	orig_y before placing a window interactively.  Fixes bug whereby
	interactive placement had the rubberband way offset from the
	pointer in "xmessage -center 'hello'"

	* move.h, move.c: Added WFrameOrIcon to return the top-level X
	window for a psw, and use that fn in InteractiveMove.   Do not
	call the invalid-interaction-hook when a grab fails in the move --
	still not really working correctly with xmag as the
	interactive-placement will fail (the grab fails because xmag does
	the grab first)

	* icons.c, borders.c: Added braces to disambiguate dangling else

	* color.h: Fix VALIDATE_COLOR, VALIDATE_COLOR_OR_NONE to use the
	do while (0) idiom

	* Grab.c: Update docs for X-grab-server, X-ungrab-server to note
	that the primitives are undefined at startup.

1998-09-22  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* xproperty.c: Removed X-atomic-property-set-if-unset!

	* scwm.c (scwm_main): call init_Grab() along with other init
	functions

	* Makefile.am: Added Grab.c to guile-snarfs

	* Grab.c: Added X-grab-server and X-ungrab-server to implement
	with-grabbed-server.

Mon Sep 21 10:08:29 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* move.c (Keyboard_shortcuts): Permit XK_KP_* to be used when
	moving and resizing. Thanks to Tim Phipps (fvwm2-based patch).

	* menu.c (PmiimMenuShortcuts): Permit XK_KP_Enter as a synonym for
	XK_Return. Thanks to Tim Phipps (fvwm2-based patch).

Sat Sep 19 12:04:53 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c: Use UNSET_SCM in ensure_valid so #f
	can be used too to skip an optional argument.

	* shutdown.c: Ungrab the server, and reset the cursor at exit.

	* module-interface.c (marshal_fvwm2_iconify_info,
	marshal_fvwm2_config_info): Test the WIN argument directly for
	being a window instead of using VALIDATE -- it doesn't make sense
	to permit interactive selection for these primitives.

Fri Sep 18 15:47:34 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c (ResetScwmexecProtocol): Added, and invoke it, in case
	XA_SCWMEXEC_REQWIN property is set on root at startup of scwm (and
	refers to a bad window)

	* move.c (AnimatedMoveWindow): Do not do anything if the move is
	to the current location (from another Tim Phipps fvwm2 patch of my
	code in that project)

1998-09-18  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* xproperty.c: Added X-atomic-property-set-if-unset!

	* xmisc.c (DrawSubImage): Offset the clip origin so masked images
	drawn at non-0,0 position are masked properly.

	* scwm.c (InitVariables): Intialize msg_window_{x,y}{,_align}
	items.

	* screen.h: Added msg_window_x, msg_window_y, msg_window_x_align,
	msg_window_y_align.

	* resize.c: Added interactive-resize-start-hook,
	interactive-resize-new-size-hook and interactive-resize-finish-hook.
	(s_set_message_window_position_x): Added
	set-message-window-position!.
	(InteractiveResize): reordered startup procedure to allow
	interactive-resize-start-hook to be called with useful arguments
	before message window is mapped

	* move.c: Added interactive-move-start-hook,
	interactive-move-new-position-hook and interactive-move-finish-hook.
	Map message window at position set by msg_window_{x,y}{,_align},
	not always the center of the screen.

	* callbacks.h: Added call3_hooks.

	* callbacks.c: Added scwm_safe_call3 and call3_hooks to support
	3-argument hooks

Thu Sep 17 15:51:48 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c: Make stick use FRAME_[XY]_VP even though slightly
	redundant, make icon-position use ICON_[XY] accessor macro

	* scwm.c: Drop reparenting debug message

	* module-interface.c (BroadcastIconInfo): Undo last change to this
	-- should use ICON_[XY]_VP, not _VIRT.

	* icons.c: Use ICON_[XY]_VIRT instead of icon_[xy]_loc in
	CreateIconWindow.  Pass ICON_[XY]_VP to CreateIconWindow, instead
	of icon_[xy]_loc

	* add_window.c: Pass ICON_[XY]_VP to CreateIconWindow, instead of
 	icon_[xy]_loc

	* events.c: Use ICON_[XY]_VP instead of icon_[xy]_loc

Thu Sep 17 12:08:23 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* events.c: Added X-DestroyNotify-hook and X-UnmapNotify-hook.

Thu Sep 17 09:10:19 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c: Added set-window-context!, window-context to support
	`with-window' macro

	* window.c: Fix FIsPartiallyInViewport to use x+width && y+height,
	not the other way around. Thanks Todd Larason!

	* scwm.c (RestoreWithdrawnLocation): Use FRAME_Y_VP, not
	FRAME_X_VP for xwc.y when undoing gravity adjustments.  Thanks
	Todd Larason!

	* module-interface.c (BroadcastIconInfo): Use ICON_[XY]_VIRT, not
	_VP when broadcasting icon positions (so sticky icons show up on
	the current desk.

	* events.c (HandleConfigureRequest): Use FRAME_[XY]_VP, not FRAME_[XY]

Wed Sep 16 15:54:33 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.h: Move struct ScwmWindow up before
	RestoreWithdrawnLocation prototype

	* scwm.c (scwm_main): Make --version print the szRepoLastChanged
	string, too.

Wed Sep 16 15:30:39 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xmisc.h, xmisc.c: Move RestoreWithdrawnLocation into scwm.c

	* window.h, window.c: Prototype for FIsPartiallyInViewport and
 	make it not static, since scwm.c now uses it in
	RestoreWithdrawnLocation.  Use FRAME_[XY] instead of accessing the
	fields directly.

	* shutdown.c: Pass a fRestart bool to Reborder()

	* scwm.h, scwm.c: Have Reborder take a bool to pass along to
	RestoreWithdrawnLocation, move RestoreWithdrawnLocation to scwm.c
	from xmisc.c; Improve RestoreWithdrawnLocation so that it uses
	FIsPartiallyInViewport

	* image.c: Check if val_load_{xpm,xbm} are not defined, and if so
	give a build error message (a common build problem is the .x files
	being empty -- this catches it and reports a much more useful
	error message before aborting).

Tue Sep 15 17:08:20 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c (MovePswToCurrentPosition): Check for not-visible
	sticky windows and move them back on screen w/ warning (only
	ifndef NDEBUG)

	* events.c: Use WIN_VP_OFFSET_[XY] in handling ConfigureNotify
	events -- fixes bug whereby drags in pager mis-moved the window,
	and whereby "xv" started up in the top-left viewport always (it
	actually moved there pretty quickly after the ConfigureNotify came
	in)

Tue Sep 15 13:37:36 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* menu.c:  Use XLookupString to convert a key event into a string
	when looking up menu shortcuts so that keypad numbers can be used
	in a menu.  Scwm-ified version of Tim Phipps's patch to my fvwm2
	menu code.

Tue Sep 15 09:30:45 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	These changes all by Todd Larason -- thanks Todd!

	* xmisc.c, xmisc.h: Added DrawSubImage as a generalization of
	DrawImage, and make DrawImage call DrawSubImage

	* menu.h: Added scmSideAlign field

	* menu.c: Added side-align option to make-menu, and honour it.

	* face.c: Make top and bottom global symbols, since the menuing
	code now uses them.

	* drawmenu.c: Improve PaintSideImage to take an align argument,
	'top, 'center, or 'bottom;  Use DrawSubImage to draw it.

Mon Sep 14 10:42:49 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* icons.c (AutoPlace): Use ICON_[XY]_VP, ICON_VP_OFFSET_[XY],
	ensure sticky icons stay on screen using some older
	previously-ifdeffed out code.

Mon Sep 14 09:34:39 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c: Added comments to MovePsw[Icon]ToCurrentPosition

	* menu.c (make_menu): Give a better warning message when
	list_of_menuitems is empty

Sun Sep 13 18:47:12 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* virtual.c (changeDesks): Call one or the other of
	MovePswIconToCurrentPosition or MovePswToCurrentPosition based on
	iconification state -- only one fvwm2 module packet should be
	sent, and we'll call the other when iconification state changes
	anyway.

	* scwm.c (InitVariables): Use scm_permanent_object to protect the
	scm for Scr.DefaultDecor so that it does not get FREEd (it is
	statically allocated)  Thanks Craig Struble!

	* decor.c: Remove reduandant FREE of SCWMDECOR(obj)->tag.  Thanks
	Craig Struble!

Sun Sep 13 12:52:03 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.h: Drop FocusOn's 2nd argument

	* window.c: Added GetWindowVirtualCenter(),
	GetSnappedViewportPositionFor() to factor some repetition.
	Simplify FocusOn, WarpOn to use them.  No longer re-snap the
	viewport on every FocusOn (now only when window is not partially
	visible)

	* virtual.c: Update Icon position in changeDesks always

	* move.c: Use ICON_VP_OFFSET_[XY] when moving icons interactively

	* module-interface.h, module-interface.c: Added
	BroadcastIconInfo() to send icon position for M_ICONIFY and
	M_ICON_LOCATION packets

	* menu.c: Added proto for InvokeUnhoverAction to avoid warnings

	* icons.c: Call BroadcastIconInfo instead of the repetitive
	Broadcast call with all args inline; Call MovePswToCurrentPosition
	in DeIconify in case it was out of position (might not update when
	not visible)

	* events.c: Call BroadcastIconInfo instead of the repetitive
	Broadcast call with all args inline

Sun Sep 13 10:41:23 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c (window-frame-border-width, window-title-size): Added
	these new primitives

Sun Sep 13 09:26:17 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* decor.h: Updated comment about DECORUNREF (not unsafe when
	mismatched any longer)

	* scwm.c (InitVariables): strdup("default") for the default decor
	to get rid of memory bug trying to FREE a statically-allocated
	string literal

Sat Sep 12 13:45:27 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* virtual.c (changeDesks): Call MovePsw*ToCurrentPosition on
	change of desks before mapping. (MoveViewport_internal) only call
	one of MovePswIconToCurrentPosition or MovePswToCurrentPosition
	depending on whether psw->fIconified

Fri Sep 11 15:43:46 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* resize.c (hide_message): XFlush after unmapping

	* menu.c: Fix bugs in hover/unhover hook calling, use
	scwm_safe_call0_sym instead of call_thunk_with_message_handler
	(_sym suffix means it calls DEREF_IF_SYMBOL first to permit
	bindings to symbols still)

	* util.c: ifdef-out call_thunk_with_message_handler -- menuing
	code was last to use it, and now that uses scwm_safe_call0 or scwm_call0_hooks

	* util.h: removed prototype for call_thunk_with_message_handler

	* virtual.c (MoveViewport_internal): Added BroadcastConfig call
	for the non-moved windows (those on other desks) to keep them at
	appropriate places (fixes bug Craig Struble reported).

Fri Sep 11 11:44:43 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* menu.c (make_menu): Do not permit empty menus; (print_menu)
	verify that pmeu->scmMenuItems is NIMP before using gh_car on it

Fri Sep 11 11:26:53 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c (move_window): Fix to use WIN_VP_OFFSET_[XY] as a
	correction for viewport->virtual and v.v.

Fri Sep 11 09:39:30 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xrm.c: Merge the X server database, the .Xdefaults* files, and
 	the application resource file, as an Intrinsic app would.  Thus,
	(X-resource-get "Scwm.aSetting") will look up that resource in the
 	users' Xdefaults or xrdb-added settings. Keep this "system"
 	database separate from the Scwm-controlled database, and permit
 	the latter to be written using `X-resource-database-save'. Added
	IntegrateNewResourceManagerProperty to be called when the root
	RESOURCE_MANAGER property changes so that the new values are seen
	right away (not integrated yet, though)

	* xrm.h: Added for IntegrateNewResourceManagerProperty() proto

	* window.h, window.c: Added move_finalize_virt, and have
	move_finalize call it.  Move-window now calls move_finalize_virt
	so those windows do not jump around.

	* events.c: Call IntegrateNewResourceManagerProperty() when
	XA_RESOURCE_MANAGER property changes on the root window (not
	tested yet)

	* add_window: Clean up the command line resource parsing stuff for
	better integration and separation from xrm.c features

Thu Sep 10 15:57:53 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c (FIsPartiallyInViewport): Added this function, and use
	it.  Remove old debugging code, #ifdef out some questionably no-op
	code, and use FRAME_[XY]_VP instead of FRAME_[XY] in some places;
	also use move_finalize to bring a window into the current
	viewport, instead of MoveTo (former uses viewport positions)

	* scwm.c: Do init_xrm after XrmInitialize so that it can merge
	databases

	* scwm-constraints.h: Added ICON_[XY]_VIRT, invert
	FRAME_[XY]_VIRT's fSticky test -- sticky windows need to have
	their Scr.V[xy] added

Thu Sep 10 11:02:16 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c: Use FRAME_[XY]_VP in SetupFrame call;  make
	move_finalize use viewport coordinates, not virtual, and add
	WIN_VP_OFFSET_* into passed in x,y before passing to virtual-coord
	based functions.

	* events.c: Use FRAME_[XY]_VP in SetupFrame call of
	HandleMapNotify(); improve debug message for that.

	* virtual.c: Broadcast the M_NEW_PAGE before moving the windows
	(cuts flicker in the pager)

	* placement.c: Use FRAME_[XY]_VP and ICON_[XY]_VP throughout
	placement functions so that they work again

	* module-interface.c: Fix synopsis sentences in docs, improve
	comment regarding ommitted field in config info marshalling

Wed Sep  9 15:16:21 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c: Initialize buttons2grab using XSERVER_MAX_BUTTONS

	* focus.c, add_window.c, binding.c: Use XSERVER_MAX_BUTTONS, not 3

	* resize.c: Fix FUNC_NAME bug in message_window_mapped_p

Wed Sep  9 14:18:18 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* resize.c: Added display-message, hide-message,
	message-window-mapped? primitives for exposing the MessageWindow
	more directly (i.e., the little single-line window that shows the
	position/size during interactive move/resizes).  May go away when
	GTk is usefully usable, but too easy to do to leave undone.

Wed Sep  9 12:48:43 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c (scwm_main): Call initSM() much later, so that it happens
	after processing of options

Wed Sep  9 09:35:39 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* shutdown.c (Done): Use w_for_scwmexec_response and reset the
	output, error, and reply properties for the scwmexec protocol when
	shutting down

	* scwm.c: Initialize w_for_scwmexec_response to None

	* events.h: Added global w_for_scwmexec_response

	* events.c: Set and reset w_for_scwmexec_response so that it's set
	during the eval of the requested expression in case Done needs to
	reply to the requesting window (on `quit' or segfault)

Wed Sep  9 09:29:25 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Added use of @SM_LIB@, now expanded by
	configure.in, so that -lSM -lICE will get added to the link command

Tue Sep  8 14:08:53 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* move.c (moveLoop): Stop using Scr.fMWMMenus.

Tue Sep  8 10:45:27 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* constraint-primitives.c: Be sure not to violate the width/height
 	increment of a window when resizing -- this was causing XEmacs to
 	request multiple new (corrected) sizes after the
 	cassowary-controlled resizing had occurred;  Fixes the assymetry
	between directly resizing a window (where the ConstrainSize call
	always was made) and the resizing of a window by Cassowary (where
	the call is now made by this fix)

	* window.c: In debug msg, give name of window that configure
 	events are sent to.

	* virtual.c (MoveViewport_internal): Don't move windows not on the
 	current desk

	* scwm.c: FIXGJB on a comment re: a fixed length string

	* screen.h: Comment out the fMWMMenus flag

	* miscprocs.c:  Drop set-menu-mwm-style!, menu-mwm-style.

	* resize.c: Some formatting + comment change

	* move.c: Use True, not 1 for a bool

	* events.c, borders.c: Use DBG, not dbg in DEBUG_RESIZE macro
	invocations.

Mon Sep  7 12:25:39 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* face.c: Fix face specifications documentation markup so it's
	warning free.

	* scwm.c: Added run-time command-line options documentation

Mon Sep  7 10:21:19 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.h: Added SCWM_VAR_INIT macro for when vars have values to
	initialize to -- SCWM_VAR now only takes two arguments, the c name
	and the scheme name

	* scwm.c: Fix init_scwm_load_path to use new SCWM_VAR so it works
	-- caused %load-path to be broken before which resulted in not
	finding scwm modules

	* menu.c, image.c: Use SCWM_VAR_INIT appropriately.

	* image.c: Fix multiple free of c_fname/c_name in
	path_expand_image_fname (thanks for report, Carl Witty!)

Sun Sep  6 15:36:11 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c: Clean up init_scwm_load_path, fix /* to /** comments
	after SCWM_VAR_READ_ONLY macros

Sun Sep  6 14:28:05 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.h: Added SCWM_VAR and SCWM_VAR_READ_ONLY macros

	* scwm.c: Use SCWM_VAR, SCWM_VAR_READ_ONLY

	* menu.c: Use SCWM_VAR

	* image.c: Use SCWM_VAR, rename loc_ prefix to pscm_ prefix as the
	macros enforce;  Turn image_not_found_hook into a real hook, and
	erase ad-hoc InvokeHook1 function.

	* events.c: Remove some obsolete comments re: send_key_press

Sun Sep  6 13:23:15 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Fix source and header targets to not duplicate
	cassowary files, and to include scwm-snarf.h

Sun Sep  6 13:06:54 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c, shutdown.c, module-interface.c, events.c,
	constraint-primitives.c, callbacks.c, add_window.c: Use SCWM_HOOK
	instead of old SCWM_DEFINE_HOOK, and move the documentation to a
	bare /** comment immediately following the SCWM_HOOK macro.  This
	is the new documentation format for hooks.  extract-docs has been
	updated, too, and now checks for coincidence of C and scheme hook
	names (providing a warning on mismatch -- caught 1 bug!)

	* callbacks.h: Rename SCWM_DEFINE_HOOK to SCWM_HOOK, make more
	robust, and do not expand the macro if SCWM_EXTRACT_COMMENTS is
	defined (since the macro is a lexical cue to the extractor)

	* scwm.c, menu.c, image.c: Mark vars and read-only vars with VAR
 	and RO-VAR comments (temporary until macro-based construct)

Sat Sep  5 13:26:05 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c: Mark new SCM variables, fix the mark code for a bug in
	requiring the decor to be set. Clean up set_window_property_x.

	* constraint-primitives.cc: #include callbacks.c inside the extern
	"C" block; added scwm-resolve-hook and call it.

	* add_window.c: Defer interrupts while initializing the new window
	struct (just in case)

Fri Sep  4 19:01:55 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* screen.h, scwm.c: Add schscreen field of struct ScreenInfo and
	initialize it.

	* screen-ci.hpp: Store the scheme-level screen object with the
	viewport position and pointer position cl variables.  Now all
	cl-variables have an attached scheme objects (via _pv)

	* scwm-constraints.hpp: Added PswFromClvPv, PclvFromClvPv to get
	at an attached ScwmWindow * or ClVariable * from a pclv->Pv().
	Store Psw's via their schwin field (their scheme level window
	object, instead of their C "ScwmWindow *").

	* constraint-primitives.cc: Call the callback attached to the
	changed-proc property of any scheme cl-variable.  Call is made
	when the variable is changed -- still need a callback on the
	resolve after all the changes are made.
	Fixed various bugs in screen_clv_* primitives

	* add-window.c: Create the scheme window to attach to Psw before
	calling CassowaryInitClVarsInPsw since the latter attaches the
	_pv's to that scheme object

	* window.c: clean up a doc comment.

	* miscprocs.c: Fix name X_rotate_cut_buffers (capitalize the X)

Fri Sep  4 12:28:33 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c (stick, unstick): Sandwich SuggestMoveWindowTo-s
	between CassowaryEdit.. EndEdit;  also add FIXGJB: rename comments
	regarding API renaming of some functions

Fri Sep  4 11:58:33 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* session-manager.h: Fix multiple-inclusion guard, and include
	config.h

	* Makefile.am: separated out the session_manager_srcs so that the
 	session manager support is only built if libSM and libICE are
 	found

Fri Sep  4 10:02:18 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.h: Added {WIN,ICON}_VP_OFFSET_{X,Y} to use instead of
	Scr.Vx, Scr.Vy to account for sticky windows appropriately.

	* window.c: Use FRAME_[XY]_VP instead of FRAME_[XY] in
	SendClientConfigureNotify.  Improve docs on "stick" command.

	* placement.c: Added debug code commented out

	* move.c, resize.c, icons.c, borders.c: Use {WIN,ICON}_VP_OFFSET_{X,Y}

	* miscprocs.c: Improve docs for refresh.

	* add_window.c: Simplify a nested conditional

Fri Sep  4 08:46:43 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* deskpage.c (display_size): Added note about display-width,
	display-height vars that base.scm sets

1998-09-03  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* xproperty.c (X_property_set_x): Would always make TYPE equal to
	NAME.

Thu Sep  3 15:26:58 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* placement.c, window.h: Change name of struct _gravity_info to
 	struct gravity_info_tag since leading underscores are (at least)
 	partially reserved for the implementation

Thu Sep  3 14:26:35 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* session-manager.h, session-manager.c: Added -- for session
 	manager support -- derived from IceWM's session manager support

	* Makefile.am (cassowary_srcs): added session-manager.[ch]

	* scwm.c: #include session-manager.h and call initSM() if
 	HAVE_LIBSM_LIBICE

	* events.c: Rename XNextEvent_orTimeout to NextScwmEvent; watch fd
	IceSMfd if it was initialized, and call IceProcessMessages when a
	message is received

	* miscprocs.c, events.h: Rename XNextEvent_orTimeout to
 	NextScwmEvent

	* xrm.c, xmisc.c, syscompat.c, shutdown.c, module-interface.c,
	menuitem.c, menu.c, log-usage.c, image.c, guile-compat.c,
	getopt1.c, getopt.c, drawmenu.c, draw-pie-menu.c, callbacks.c:
	Add footer with Emacs local variable settings for C mode indentation

Thu Sep  3 09:51:23 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c (focus, warp-to-window): Improve documentation to
 	mention that the target window is not raised

Wed Sep  2 17:10:55 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.h: Added Hi{Relief,Shadow,Text,Back}Color members of
	struct ScwmWindow

	* window.c: Mark new members of struct ScwmWindow.  Added
	`get-window-colors', `get-highlight-window-colors',
	`set-window-highlight-foreground!',
	`set-window-highlight-background!'

	* borders.c: Use new fns PixelHi{Text,Back}FromPsw for selecting
	the color for a highlighted window -- those fns use the new
	per-window highlight colors, or fall back to the decor settings if
	no per-window highlight color is specified (ie, they are #f)

	* add_window.c: init new members of struct ScwmWindow

Wed Sep  2 13:11:47 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c (window-icon-shaped?, window-shaped?): Added new
	primitives.  Also fixed some uses of strings instead of FUNC_NAME
	as args to VALIDATE* utility routine

	* miscprocs.c (X-rotate-cut-buffers, elapsed-time): Added new
	primitives.

	* color.c (make-reversed-color): Added new primitive, use
	invert_color helper.

Wed Sep  2 10:42:45 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xproperty.c: Update the docs -- mention 'root-window for
 	X-property-get, and use e.g.  "value" instead of VALUE when
 	referring to the list of items returned
	(arguments are in uppercase and are marked up differently).

Wed Sep  2 09:53:29 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c: Use FRAME_[XY]_VP in SetScwmWindowGeometry,
 	SetScwmWindowPosition; also for calls to SetupFrame,
 	RedrawOutlineAtNewPosition.  Fixed comment of resize-to (does
 	*not* include window decoration size).  Added comments re:
 	viewport vs. virtual positionness

	* scwm-constraints.cc, borders.c, add_window.c: Added comments re:
 	viewport vs. virtual positionness

	* resize.c: Add Scr.V[xy] to drag positions in resizing, add
	comments re: viewport vs. virtual positionness

Tue Sep  1 16:28:49 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* move.c: Updated docs to clarify virtual positionness

	* scwm-constraints.h: Added FRAME_[XY]_VIRT, document _VP suffix
	to mean viewport position (since it's a bit ambiguous, unfortunately)

	* window.c: Rename move_to to move_window, and make it use virtual
	coords.  Fix animated moves to use virtual coords.  Fix
	ResizePswToCurrentSize to use FRAME_[XY]_VP.  Updated some docs.

Tue Sep  1 14:26:53 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Added cassowary_headers, and use it to add to
	noinst_HEADERS

	* xmisc.h, xmisc.c: Added FXIsWindowMapped()

	* window.h, window.c: Added MovePswIconToCurrentPosition(), use
	FRAME_X_VP, FRAME_Y_VP in MovePswToCurrentPosition.  Make
	stickiness result in changes to the real position of the window,
	since now windows store their virtual position, and are converted
	to viewport positions at a pretty low level (when positioned using
	MovePsw* functions)

	* virtual.c: Simplify MoveViewport_internal, since now windows do
	not need to be moved directly -- less work needs to be done since
	windows store their virtual position instead of their viewport
	position.

	* scwm-constraints.h: Added FRAME_[XY]_VP, ICON_[XY]_VP macros

	* scwm-constraints.cc: Make CassowarySetCValuesAndSolve() call
	MovePswToCurrentPosition when the solver is not in use.

	* move.c: Use MovePswIconToCurrentPosition() instead of multiple
 	XMoveWindow calls.  Correct for Scr.V[xy] in pointer position in
 	moveLoop.  Use rubberband for initial placement even when
	Cassowary is on.

	* module-interface.c: Use FRAME_[XY]_VP, ICON_[XY]_VP in the
	marshalling functions

	* icons.c: Use MovePswIconToCurrentPosition, and use virtual
	coords in AutoPlace (instead of viewport coordinates).

	* events.c: Clean up positioning of icon_w and icon_pixmap_w so
	that the latter is the thing that icon_[xy]_loc refers to.


1998-09-01  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* xproperty.c (string_to_X_atom, X_atom_to_string): New
	primitives.

Mon Aug 31 14:05:09 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.h, window.c, color.c, callbacks.c: Remove ifdef-d out
	code.

Mon Aug 31 13:09:50 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xproperty.c: #include errors.h for warning

	* xmisc.c: Remove #if 0'd code, and unused vars

	* virtual.c, move.c, complex.c: #include util.h for warning

	* util.h: Add prototype for ms_sleep, and #include screen.h for
	ScwmDecor definition

	* screen.h: Rename multiple-inclusion guard to SCREEN_H__

1998-08-31  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* window.c (s_window_id): Handle 'root-window.

	* xproperty.c: X properties are no longer SMOBS. Two functions
	`X-property-set!', and `X-property-get' now deal with them. The
	old interface is gone.

Fri Aug 28 16:58:40 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* move.c, menu.c, complex.c, window.c, virtual.c: Use new ms_sleep instead of
	usleep.

	* util.c: Write ms_sleep to call usleep and possibly sleep (if
	for more than 1 second)

	* syscompat.h, syscompat.c: Fix prototype and defintion for usleep
	-- was treating arg as milli instead of micro seconds.
 	Thanks Perry E. Metzger!

Fri Aug 21 13:14:12 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ALL, scwm.h: Replace SCM_DEFER_INTS with gh_defer_ints(),
 	SCM_ALLOW_INTS with gh_allow_ints(), SCM_CAR with gh_car, SCM_CDR
 	with gh_cdr, scm_listify with gh_list, scm_cons with gh_cons, most
 	SCM_SETCDR with gh_set_cdr_x, most SCM_SETCAR with gh_set_car_x,
 	scm_apply with gh_apply.  Use SCWM_NEWCELL_SMOB for getting a new
 	cell and initializing the car and cdr (since SCM_SETC[AD]R need to
 	be used on a fresh cell for now since guile's scm_set_car which
 	gh_set_car_x calls does assertion checking)

Thu Aug 20 16:58:52 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* events.c (HandleButtonPress): Clean up redundant cond'l on
	pswCurrent, and begin to try to get fClickToFocusPassesClick to
	permit immediate action when on decorations and border even when #f

Thu Aug 20 15:57:22 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ALL, errors.h: Fix some C-portability problems with DBUG and
 	DBUG_RESIZE macros.  Now double-quote at call site, and give the
 	DBG stream argument as first arg.  Replace scwm_error's
	number-based system w/ string based system until we decide to do
	this the right way.

Thu Aug 20 14:41:28 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* borders.c (SetupFrame): Call UnsetShapedTitlebar if
	!fSquashedTitlebar, and add that routine.

	* util.c: Remove #ifdef-d out call to SetTitleBar in
	redraw_titlebars that seemed redundant.

Thu Aug 20 13:50:38 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c (scwm_main): Use scm_setlocale, #include X11/Xlocale if
	X_LOCALE is set, and initialize locale support for X with
	XSupportsLocale() and XSetLocaleModifiers().  Thanks S. Senda!

Thu Aug 20 12:16:34 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c: Rewrite one line description of Scwm:
	A highly dynamic and extensible X11 window manager embedding guile
	scheme.

	* icons.c: Change AutoPlace behaviour for fStickyIcon -- do not
	put on same page in center of the window -- use non-sticky icon
	code instead.

	* window.c: Remove RaiseWindow calls from FocusOn and WarpOn.
	Thanks Danius Michaelides!

Fri Aug 14 20:40:17 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c: Remove FIXDOC comment:  Yes: WIN's gets marked-up
	  correctly with the perl extract-docs (not sure about the guile
	  version -- it's worth testing)

	* face.c: Convert the Face Flags and Face Specification Flags into
	  DocBook tables from plain text.

Fri Aug 14 19:28:13 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* deskpage.c: Use <informalexample> tag instead of <code> (the
	  latter is not a DocBook tag -- I made it up a ways back because
	  I was too lazy to look up the right markup)

Thu Aug 13 11:56:46 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* resize.c: Added DBUG code for ConstrainSize

	* add_window.c: Do not add in psw->bw to frame_width, frame_height
	  (was causing windows to grow in size on decorating).  This
	  reverts an earlier change which was thought to be necessary but
	  was fixed by making ConstrainSize round instead of truncate.

Thu Aug 13 11:17:12 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* placement.c: Fix bug reported by <forcer@mindless.com> re:
	  interactive placement not moving the window to the current
	  pointer position initially.

Thu Aug 13 10:03:08 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c, move.c: Use (possibly) shaded height in
	  ResizePswToCurrentSize, SetScwmWindowPosition, InteractiveMove

	* virtual.c, deskpage.c: Do not use bogus 10000 special number in
	  FNeedsPaging (patch from Robert Bihlmeyer); use #f instead for
	  s_set_edge_scroll_delay_x

Wed Aug 12 18:07:23 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c, module-types.h: Rename M_ERROR macro to M_FVWM_ERROR
	  (conflict with a solaris header file)

	* binding.c: Remove some unused variables

	* syscompat.h: #include <unistd.h> for usleep

Wed Aug 12 17:26:30 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* move.c: Added Todd Larson's patch

	* window.c: Let move-to take #f for X or Y to mean don't move
	  along that coordinate.

Wed Aug 12 14:59:21 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c: Added resize-frame-to which does what resize-to used
	  to do, and made resize-to's size talk about the client window
	  size;  also added window-frame-size with old behaviour and make
	  window-size return four values, instead of just two  -- 3rd and
	  4th are size in resize increments.

	* resize.c: Rewrite makemult as a function, and make it round,
	  instead of truncate

	* placement.c: Do not call SetupFrame from PlaceWindow -- let it
	  get called later in HandleMapNotify.

	* add_window.c: Be sure to initialize psw->xboundary_width and
	  psw->bw properly before calling ConstrainSize.  Add psw->bw into
	  psw->initial size estimates for the frame

Wed Aug 12 09:22:35 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* color.c: Invert gh_number_p tests in various type checking to
	  permit numbers.  Thanks Dale Smith!

Tue Aug 11 18:45:33 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c, borders.c, borders.h, placement.c:
	  Removed SendEvent argument from SetupFrame, and its calls.

	* borders.c: Added some debug code, and unmap decoration windows
	  that are not supposed to be mapped

Mon Aug 10 17:45:55 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c: Added SendClientConfigureNotify fn, and call it from
	  MovePswToCurrentPosition and ResizePswToCurrentSize (instead of
	  having the code in SendClientConfigureNotify inline in
	  SetupFrame).  Rename local var w to cpix, since w implies an
	  X-Window to me.

	* scwm.c: Added error checking after opening of display in if
	  (!single) branch

	* resize.c: Use psw->xboundary_width instead of
	  psw->boundary_width for width of the window

	* borders.c: Move the SendClientConfigureNotify code into function
	  by that name in window.c (from SetupFrame).  Added macro to
	  check 'no-side-decorations property, and honour it by using
	  xboundary_width instead of boundary_width, as appropriate.
	  (This is not yet a debugged feature -- unhighlighted windows do
	  not display properly, and the top boundary decoration sidebar
	  should probably be dropped when side-decorations are dropped
	  (just letting the titlebar serve as the top boundary decoration)

	* window.h: Added xboundary_width field of struct ScwmWindow, and
	  use it in GRAV_X_ADJUSTMENT macro

1998-08-13  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* deskpage.c (s_set_edge_scroll_delay_x): Change calling
 	convention. usec == #f now means that scrolling is prohibited.
 	Warn whenever old usage of usec is detected.

	* virtual.c (FNeedsPaging): "Scrolling prohibited" is now
 	signalled with a negative time.

Fri Aug  7 20:04:44 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Added changed.c, log-usage.c, log-usage.h.
	  changed.c is automatically managed by the CVSROOT/loginfo admin
	  file on the server, using the make-repo-date-file from
	  utilities/dev/make-repo-date-file.  Note that after a commit,
	  devs will need to "cvs update changed.c" to make changed.c correct

	* log-usage.c, log-usage.h: Added, defined SendUsagePacket()
	  function

	* miscprocs.c: Added scwm-version-date primitive to give the
	  string in changed.c.

	* scwm.c (scwm_maybe_send_thankyou_packet): Add this function,
 	have it call SendUsagePacket() from log-usage.c, and call the
 	function after run_startup_hook() is invoked.  Can set
 	SCWM_DO_NOT_LOG_USAGE environment variable to turn off, and must
 	set thank-scwm-authors-with-usage-note to #t for any packets to
 	leave user's machine

Fri Aug  7 18:03:29 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* window.c: Rename list-windows-in-stacking-order to
 	list-stacking-order; make it list each window only once (previous
 	version gave one instance for each of main window, icon and icon
 	title).

Fri Aug  7 10:43:43 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c: create scmFixedFont global object to use in a last-ditch
	  need for a font; fix unrelated compiler warning

	* font.h, font.c: Added global scmFixedFont which should always be
	  initialized and contain the fixed font

	* drawmenu.c: Patched PscwmFontForMenuItem to use FONT() instead
	  of completely wrong (scwm_font *) cast.  Thanks Craig Kaplan!

	* borders.c: Unmap the side windows if their width/height would be
	  zero.  Fixes problems I noticed with robbe.scwmrc's barebones decor

	* scwm-constraints.cc: Use resolve() form instead of resolve(..)
	  for changing virtual position so that it works with nested
	  edits.

Thu Aug  6 22:04:48 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* resize.c, move.c: Remove ifdefs around the code to manage
	  changing the virtual screen w/ cassowary since I now have
	  nestable beginEdits;  Fix SnapCoordsToEdges to remove some
	  errors that Tom Larason brought to my attention (and provided a
	  patch for that I used slightly modified)

	* borders.c, windows.c: Handle set-mwm-border! more accurately,
	  including fixing the border-width of the frame and Parent
	  windows, and do the border resizing in SetupFrame.

Thu Aug  6 11:55:21 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* constraint-primitives.cc: Add cassowary_scm.h to avoid warning
	  re: init_cassowary_scm.

	* add_window.c: put back in the ResizePswToCurrentSize in
	  CassowaryEndEdit() for non-cassowary builds.

Wed Aug  5 20:17:56 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* borders.c: Added SQUASHED_TITLEBAR_P macro and squashed-titlebar
	  feature (set-object-property! win 'squashed-titlebar #t), then
	  resize the window to see rough but working version -- requires
	  XShape extension.

	* window.h, decorations.c, add_window.c: renamed wShaped field of
	  ScwmWindow to fShaped, and make it a Bool instead of int.

	* window.c: Clean up CopySetAllFlags to be consistent w/ use of
	  braces.

	* scwm.h: Added GDB_STOP macro for inserting a breakpoint in the
	  source code for walking through newly written code.

	* scwm.c: Call init_xrm(), XrmInitialize() (latter always
	  should've been called); remove call to init_cassowary_scm() --
	  let init_constraint_primitives() do that

	* scwm-constraints.cc, add_window.c: Don't do anything on CassowaryEndEdit() if
	  no solver; also, make XrmDatabase db non-file-static, so xrm.c
	  can use it.

	* constraint-primitives.cc: Call init_cassowary_scm() here,
	  instead of from scwm.c

	* move.c: Factor out SnapCoordsToEdges, and fix off by 1 error on
	  left and top edges;  clean up some of the paging stuff while
	  moving so that SetupFrame is called a lot less frequently
	  (though it's still broken for cassowary pending the virtual
	  screen rewrite)

Wed Aug  5 20:09:52 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xrm.c: Added for primitives X-resource-put and X-resource-get

	* Makefile.am: Updated for xrm.c, xrm.x

Tue Aug  4 17:53:17 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* constraint-primitives.cc: Added cl-windows-of-constraint
	  primitive

Tue Aug  4 14:57:44 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c: Restore the call to SetupFrame after animated
	  shade/unshade since combinations of animated/unanimated
	  shading/unshading fail unless the state of the window is
	  well-defined.

	* scwm-constraints.hpp, constraint-primitives.cc: Make _scmXL,
	  _scmXR and _scmYT, _scmYB all fields, instead of forcing writing
	  the linear-expressions to find the right coordinate of a window at
	  the scheme level.

	* move.c: Remove mention of set-opaque-move-size! from docs for
	  interactive-move.

Tue Aug  4 12:01:32 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* menu.h, menu.c: Added x_pos, y_pos, and left_side_p args to
	  popup_menu, improve arg processing; added
	  SetPopupMenuPositionFromDecoration to help out.

	* binding.c: Cleanup docs for mouse-event-type

Mon Aug  3 16:13:52 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c: Use new macro SET_BIT_FOR_OBJ_PROP within
	  FlagsBitsFromSw to do the right thing with WinlistSkip,
	  Maximized, etc; ifdef-out a redundant BroadcastConfig

	* decorations.c: Un-ifdef out the resetting of fBorder when
	  boundary_width is 0.  There still seems to be a race condition
	  with the FvwmWinList coming up w/o a title whereby the
	  Configure notification to a module hangs when writing to the
	  pipe (a hypothesis---not fully observed).

Mon Aug  3 13:24:19 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c: Added list-all-windows-in-stacking-order primitve, use
	  gh_cons instead of scm_cons in list-all-windows and update its
	  comment

	* scwm.c, scwm.h: added JunkWindow, to replace JunkChild,
	  JunkRoot, since we really need only one for the xlib calls

Sun Aug  2 17:57:14 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* resize.c, virtual.h, virtual.c: Added FNeedsPaging() as a pretest for
	  HandlePaging() -- use it in resize.c, but not yet in move.c.

	* move.c: Use 2 pixel range for testing if we're on the boundary
	  for fResize==True in Keyboard_shortcuts

	* menu.c: Make submenus automatically select the first item in the
	  submenu; require C+<key> for the alphanumeric menu movement keys

Sun Aug  2 16:37:31 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xmisc.h, xmisc.c, draw_menu.c: Patches from ITANI Eiichiro
	  <emu@ceres.dti.ne.jp> for I18N ComputeXTextWidth problems.

	* window.c: Pass no psw to Keyboard_shortcuts in DeferExecution;
	  clean up some comments

	* shutdown.c: Fixed reorganization problem so segfault still tries
	  to clean up the display if the display is already successfully
	  opened.

	* scwm-screen-ci.hpp, scwm-constraints.hpp: Do not add
	  automatically-destroyed constraints into the solver.  Really
	  need to do the handle wrappers of constraints, expressions, and
	  vars!  Use new ClConstraint->Pv() to point at the scheme object
	  that is that constraint.

	* resize.c, move.c: Try to get paging during a resize/move right
	  even with Cassowary in use; Fix Keyboard_shortcuts to ignore a
	  NULL psw for DeferExecution


1998-08-01  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@localhost.localdomain>

	* icons.c (CreateIconWindow): Check if psw->icon_pixmap_w is None
	before trying to set it's attributes.

	* window.c (force_icon_redraw): Check if psw->icon_w is None
	before destroying it.

1998-08-01  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny3-12.ix.netcom.com>

	* miscprocs.c: Rename set-click-time! to set-click-delay! and
	X-server-set-synchronize! to set-X-server-synchronize!. Added some
	corresponding getters for setters that did not have them before:
	menu-mwm-style, title-justify, click-delay, title-height,
	click-delay, colormap-focus, smart-placement-is-really-smart?,
	click-to-focus-passes-click?, and click-to-focus-raises?.

Fri Jul 31 20:39:23 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c, resize.c, move.c, resize.h: Added ScwmWindow *,
	  fResize args to Keyboard_shortcuts so resize behaviour can be
	  smarter. Use width_inc, height_inc for keyboard resize

	* binding.c: Fix possible out-of-bounds array read access.

	* add_window.c: Move call to CassowaryNewWindow hook a bit
	  earlier, before the PlaceWindow call, since that call does a
	  move_finalize which needs the stay constraints to already be added

	* shutdown.c: Simplify Done() function and call SaveDesktopState
	  always (except for seg fault).

Fri Jul 31 18:42:23 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* shutdown.c: Do the XSelectInput, XSync, and XCloseDisplay in all
	  shutdown cases, not just if we're going to restart.

	* scwm-constraints.cc: Added note about intentional (for now)
	  memory leak

	* decorations.c: Guard an XFree with a test to ensure the pointer
	  is non-null (XFree, unlike ansi C's free, is not guaranteed to
	  deal with null pointers properly).

	* constraint-primitives.cc (ScwmResolve): Only move if not resized.

1998-07-31  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny5-12.ix.netcom.com>

	* font.c, font.h, decor.c: Rename set-window-font! to
	set-title-font! for precision and to make clear that it does not
	affect a window object. Add title-font, icon-font and menu-font
	accessor functions.

1998-07-31  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny3-12.ix.netcom.com>

	* events.c (send_button_press): Use the new
	FButtonToBnumModifiers, and take a single mouse button specifier
	argument, not an integer button number and integer modifier
	mask. Also make send_key_press pass the needed func_name argument
	for FKeyToKeysymModifiers.

	* binding.c, binding.h: Add new FButtonToBnumModifiers and
	add_binding functions and use them for better abstraction. Push
	error checking of contexts into compute_contexts. Change a few
	function signatures to pass a procedure name for the sake of error
	reporting. Much redundant code removed this way. No longer accept
	symbols in place of procedures in key/mouse bindings.

	* deskpage.c: API review continues: Split set-edge-wrap! into
	set-edge-x-wrap! and set-edge-y-wrap!; split set-edge-scroll! into
	set-edge-x-scroll!  and set-edge-y-scroll!; split
	set-edge-resistance! into set-edge-scroll-delay! and
	set-edge-move-threshold!. Added corresponding accessors:
	edge-x-wrap, edge-y-wrap, edge-x-scroll, edge-y-scroll,
	edge-scroll-delay, edge-move-threshold. Reordered the file so all
	getters are near their setters. Removed extraneous instances of
	SCM_REDEFER_INTS/SCM_REALLOW_INTS.

	* decor.c (s_window_decor): Fixed a minor typo.

1998-07-30  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny3-12.ix.netcom.com>

	* decor.c: Make the window argument to `set-window-decor!'
	mandatory and first. Add the corresponding getter, `window-decor'.

	* color.c: API review: Added menu-foreground, menu-background,
	menu-stipple primitives w/ docs.

	* window.h, window.c: Window structure changes, phase 1. Added
	other_properties member to window structure; GC protect it and
	initialize it to an empty hash table. Add set-window-property! and
	window-property primitives. Right now they only get and set
	properties in this hash table. "Magical" properties and change
	notification will come in later, as will other planned changes.

	ICCCM compliant gravity handling:

	* window.h: Define gravity_info type, used to encode gravity
	offset information. Add a grav field of type gravity_info to the
	window structure; remove the xdiff and ydiff fields. Prototype the
	new set_window_internal_title_height which should be used when
	changing the title height for a window, including adding or
	removing the title bar. Add GRAV_X_ADJUSTMENT and
	GRAV_Y_ADJUSTMENT macros to find the right amount the frame needs
	to be gravity-adjusted relative to a desired app window position.

	window.c: Remove window-diff-deltas, since xdiff and ydiff no
	longer exist. Add set_window_internal_title_height to adjust the
	window's title height safely, respecting gravity, and
	broadcasting. Fix show-titlebar, hide-titlebar, and
	set-border-width! to respect gravity.

	add_window.c: Remove SetupFrame call when adding window (moved to
	placement.c). Remove all mucking with xdiff and ydiff, they are
	gone.

	placement.c: Make GetGravityOffsets merely set the grav field of
	the window struct as appropriate instead of trying to return
	values. Move the table of gravity offset types to file static, not
	function static, and make it contain all three gravity_info
	fields. Remove CorrectPositionToStayOnscreen and all calls to it,
	it was pointless voodoo code anyway. Remove all move_finalize's
	intended to keep the window as requested; merely do nothing in
	those cases. in PlaceWindow, place the window exactly where
	requested, as adjusted by gravity, before calling the placement
	proc.

	util.c (redraw_titlebars): use set_window_internal_title_height to
	set the new titlebar height, not the previous weirdness.

	miscprocs.c (set_title_height_x): Reverse the sign sense of
	extra_height.

	font.c (set_window_font_x): Reverse the sign sense of extra_height.

	xmisc.c: Release the window by reversing the gravity adjustment
	currently in effect, not any of that xdiff/ydiff junk.

	To be resolved: should the user be able to get and/or set the
	window gravity?

Thu Jul 30 20:16:12 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* constraint-primitives.cc, scwm-constraints.cc,
	scwm-constraints.h, scwm-screen-ci.hpp: Added Scr.Vx, Scr.Vy
	clvars, put stays on them, added CassowaryModifyOpaqueFlag

	* makefile.cassowary: Added scwm-screen-ci.hpp

Thu Jul 30 20:08:25 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* virtual.h, virtual.c: Rename MoveViewport into
	MoveViewport_internal, and make MoveViewport muck with the
	constraint variables before calling MoveViewport_internal.

	* scwm.c: Call CassowaryInitClVarsInPscreen

	* resize.c, move.c: Use CassowaryModifyOpaqueFlag to ensure that
	we always do opaque moves and resizes w/ constraint solver; fixed
	bugs in moving of icon w/ rubberbanding

	* menu.c: Return the value of the called lambda for a menu item
	execution to support the select-window-from-window-list
	functionality.

	* font.c: patch from Itani for I18N.

	* borders.c: Fix bug in corner_width too small when no title width
	-- make corners be at least 12 pixels.

	* add_window.c: Add constraint dummies.

Wed Jul 29 20:23:03 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* move.c, xmisc.c, font.c: Add a scope brace and use pxfs in
	  ComputeXTextWidth; use XFONTID in DisplayMessage.  use
	  XFIXEDFONTNAME, not XFIXEDFONTSET in font.c. All I18N
	  fixes.

	* face.c: Make set-face-flag! a primitive, reorder the function to
	  avoid a prototype.

	* decorations.c: Don't turn off fBorder if boundary_width == 0;
	  keep them orthogonal

	* borders.h: Fix the FULL_HILITE enum value.  Fixes bug in the
	  redraw of the corners

	* borders.c: Clean up SetBorderX a bit.  Use SAFE_IMAGE in
	  DrawButton, and bail if we fail to get the image.

	* window.c: Fix docs of restack-windows

	* resize.c, virtual.c: remove one, and ifdef out another probably
	  spurious RemoveRubberbandOutline call.

	* shutdown.c: Do not call0_hooks on a segfault.  Only do X stuff
	  if dpy is non-null

	* scwm.c: Use XmuPrintDefaultErrorMessage, if user has libXmu


Wed Jul 29 12:24:49 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* util.c: Use idiomatic for loop for traversing ScwmWindow list,
	  fixed a bug and some redundant code.

	* font.c: Use scm_permanent_object, not scm_protect_object for
	  str_fixed, and others.

	* decor.c: Use UNSET_SCM instead of testing for equality with
	  SCM_UNDEFINED so #f counts as undef'd also.

Wed Jul 29 11:32:34 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm-constraints.hpp, scwm-constraints.cc, scwm.c, screen.h:
	  Added pssci field of struct ScreenInfo and initialize it to NULL

	* constraint-primitives.cc: Added accessors for screen-clv-vx,
	  screen-clv-vy.

	* borders.c, add_window.c: Remove the setting of title_height in
	  SetupFrame -- do it in AddWindow instead.

	* makefile.cassowary: First go at a scwm_cl.static target.  Fails
	  because other libraries aren't statically linked.

	* scwm-screen-ci.hpp: Added, for ClVariables attached to scruct
	  ScreenInfo.

Mon Jul 27 20:45:24 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* {move,resize,window,scwm-constraints}.c: Got resizing and moving
	with rubberband to work using a more clean framework.

Mon Jul 27 20:08:39 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* miscprocs.c, screen.h: Remove OpaqueMoveSize,
	set-opaque-move-size! primitive, since it's now an argument to
	interactive-move and interactive-resize

	* window.h, window.c:  Added SetScwmWindowPosition, and added
	fOpaque flag to both it and SetScwmWindowGeometry

	* scwm-constraints.h, scwm-constraints.c, add_window.c: Added
	fOpaque flag to SuggestSizeWindowTo and SuggestMoveWindowTo

	* resize.c: Display size in window units, not pixels

1998-07-27  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am: added move.x for interactive-move (was in window.x)

	* font.h, icons.c, events.c, drawmenu.c, decor.c, borders.c:
	  Cleanup the horrible I18N #ifdefs -- still more needs to be done
	  with XDrawString vs. XmbDrawString, but stuff is better
	  now. Added XFONTID to get at the ->fid field.

	* binding.c, binding.h: Moved GrabKeys, GrabButtons into here.
	  Fix bug with bind-mouse in not grabbing the new button (renamed
	  context to wincontext so future bugs [confusion of var context
	  with var contexts] will be more obvious).  Use for loops for
	  iterating the windows, not while loops.

	* add_window.h, add_window.c: Move Grab/Ungrab functions into
	  binding.c.  Pretty major cleanup and documenting of AddWindow
	  routine -- reduce redundancies, call XSaveContext right after
	  creating each window

	* xmisc.h, xmisc.c: Added WXGetPointerOffsets, WXGetPointerChild,
	  removed bogus XGetGeometryCacheIt since I found the bug that I
	  introduced that fn for.  Added SzExtractTextPropValue,
	  ComputeXTextWidth.  Renamed FXGetPointerWindowOffsets to
	  WXGetPointerWindowOffsets, and have it return the child window
	  (Changes throughout all source to use WXGetPointerWindowOffsets)

	* window.h: document more ScwmWindow fields

	* move.c, window.c: moved interactive_move into move.c from
	  window.c;  added primitives: icon-position and
	  window-diff-deltas

	* scwm.h: comment out FFromSCMBool, FInvertFromSCMBool since
	  gh_scm2bool exists.  Added
	  COPY_BOOL_OR_ERROR_DEFAULT_{TRUE,FALSE}.  Drop externs of Window
	  BlackoutWin.

	* scwm.c: Call init_move, move JunkVars into xmisc.c

	* scwm-constraints.h: Added FRAME_X_NONVIRT, FRAME_Y_NONVIRT (stll
	  need to be used far more often to make viewport stuff work)

	* resize.h, resize.c:  Added InteractiveResize, and make that in
	  the public interface, instead of interactive_resize (which now
	  mostly just calls the former).  Added fOpaque flag to
	  InteractiveResize, option to interactive_resize primitive.

	* move.h, move.c: Added fOpaque flag to InteractiveMove, option to
	  interactive_move primitive; fixed bugs in dealing with icons,
	  move ComputeXTextWidth into xmisc.c, and make it take an extra
	  arg, the length, or -1 to mean use strlen.  Move
	  interactive-move primitive to here from window.c, and make
	  move.x get generated.

	* placement.c: save frame position in xdiff, ydiff using
	  FRAME_X_NONVIRT, Y_NONVIRT

	* miscprocs.c: Added X-server-set-synchronize primitive


1998-07-27  Robert Bihlmeyer  <e9426626@stud2.tuwien.ac.at>

	* xproperty.c: Forgotten inclusion of guile-compat.h prevented
	1.2-compatibility.

1998-07-26  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.h, window.c:  Remove the SMOB functions from window.h.
	  Added MoveTo, ResizeTo, MoveResizeTo, and use them instead of
	  SetupFrame most places throughout scwm.  Move move_finalize,
	  MovePswToCurrentPosition, ResizePswToCurrentSize up
	  earlier in window.c, and document them all (see code).

	* virtual.c: Use MoveTo, not SetupFrame.

	* placement.c: Rename keep_on_screen to
	  CorrectPositionToStayOnscreen, since it doesn't actually move a
	  window, it just fiddles with coords.

	* move.c: Fix animated window shade to not require a redundant
	  SetupFrame call.

	* icons.c: Use move_finalize instead of SetupFrame.

	* events.c: Use MoveResizeTo, ResizeTo instead of SetupFrame.  I
	  think lots of redundant M_CONFIGURE_WINDOW fvwm2 module packets
	  are sent out! FIXGJB

	* decor.c: Use ResizeTo instead of SetupFrame.  There is an extra
	  distinction that should probably be made between calls that
	  change the decorations and thus affect the overall frame size
	  and calls that are intended to resize the client window (the
	  latter involves the client application, but both involve the
	  constraint solver)

	* dbug_resize.h: Generalize for non gcc compilers like DBUG is.

	* borders.c: Fix some bugs in window shading, be a bit more
	  careful about X11 calls, and comment SetupFrame more
	  thoroughly.

1998-07-26  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* resize.c, resize.h, scwm.c: Added init_resize_gcs() and call it
	  after the X11 stuff has been initialized

1998-07-26  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Pretty massive cleanup of interfaces.  Removed unneeded
	  prototypes from header files -- in particular the primitives
	  are no longer exposed in the header files unless they are used
	  directly by C code (such instances are marked as encapsulation
	  violations to be cleaned up at some point).  Also, use
	  window_fwd.h instead of including window.h, where possible.
	  Note that the init_MODULE function prototypes for SMOBs are
	  all put in scm_init_funcs.h by the build procedure, so they
	  are no longer listed in the .h files.  In particular, this
	  means that some header files are nearly empty, but I've chosen
	  to keep them around since at some point a public C interface
	  may be added for them.  Sometimes macros that were in the
	  header file have been moved into the top of the .c file if
	  they are just implementation details hiding behind the public
	  interface of the module.  Also note that the mark_, print_,
	  free_ functions are no longer prototyped-- they hide behind
	  init_XXXX's registering of the SMOB type.

	* window.c: rearrange ordering of some funcs to avoid forward
	  decls.

	* placement.c: use move_finalize instead of move_to-- the former
	  is part of the C interface of ScwmWindows, while the latter is
	  a primitive that does unnecessary work;  Also use
	  InteractiveMove instead of interactive-move for the same
	  reason.

	* move.h, move.c: Simplify interface to InteractiveMove, and
	  make it know all about finding the button-click mouse position
	  and dealing with icons (moved the code from the one call to
	  InteractiveMove into the function, and then added another call
	  to InteractiveMove from placement.c)

	* events.c: Use Iconify (C public-interface function) instead of
	  iconify (primitive)

	* binding.c: have_orig_position is now a Bool, not an int

	* window_fwd.h: Added, for use by header files that only need
	  pointers to the ScwmWindow struct (must use struct ScwmWindow,
	  or "#define ScwmWindow  struct ScwmWindow" -- be sure to
	  #undef at end of header file

1998-07-26  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* screen.h: Pruned and cleaned up the ScreenInfo struct a lot.
	  MyDisplayXXX is now DisplayXXX -- Fixed uses of DisplayXXXX
	  throughout;  use PackedBool macro and expand flags bitmasked
	  field, so Scr.flags & WindowsCaptured is now just
	  Scr.fWindowsCaptured [dropped the #defines of the flag
	  constants]; made GET_DECOR look more like a macro since it can't
	  be used much like a function at all; drop CornerWidth, NumBoxes
	  fields -- unused;  drop COLORMAP_FOLLOWS_MOUSE,
	  COLORMAP_FOLLOWS_FOCUS #defines, and use fColormapFollowsMouse
	  boolean instead.

	* miscprocs.c, deskpage.c: simplify s_set_menu_mwm_style_x, other
	  settors to use COPY_BOOL_OR_ERROR

	* color.c: #ifdef out first of multiple calls to SetBorder to see
	  if there is any crazy (undocumented) reason why multiple calls
	  are needed

	* borders.h: drop redundant prototype for SetTitleBar()

	* events.c: added some debug code to test a claim in a comment
	  regarding when to raise a window when !Scr.fClickToFocusRaises

	* miscprocs.c, resize.c: move set_rubber_band_mask_x from
	  miscprocs.c into resize.c, and initialize DrawRubberBandGC in
	  init_resize()

	* placement.c: clean up SmartPlacement a bit

	* util.c: clean up redraw_titlebars

	* borders.c: Added init_border to initialize TransMaskGC, now
	  file-static (not really the right thing, is it that expensive to
	  create GCs that we don't want to do it for each button draw?),
	  use GET_DECOR (renamed from GetDecor to be more obviously a macro)

	* shutdown.c: improve startup-hook documentation

	* scwm.h, window.h: Moved PackedBool here from window.h, moved
	  COPY_BOOL_OR_ERROR and COPY_INVERT_BOOL_OR_ERROR from window.h,
	  since these are now used in more places than just window.c;
	  struct ScwmWindow -- drop orig_x, orig_y -- just
	  orig_{width,height} now.  Drop CORNER_WIDTH macro -- unused.

	* window.c: Don't call SetupFrame on animated shade/unshade --
	  only do it on unanimated.

1998-07-25  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* *.c: mark_XXXXX -- use GC_MARK_SCM_IF_SET pervasively, instead
	  of scm_gc_mark (just in case something is not initialized)

	* *.c: use new SCWM_SYMBOL macros pervasively

	* callbacks.c: doc string spelling fix, drop a FIXDOC since the
	  extractor now gets HOOK comments

	* constraint-primitives.cc: Use a set, not a list for the dirty
	  windows.  Better debug support on ScwmResolve.  Clear the set of
	  dirty windows when there is a new master solver.  Added doc strings

	* decor.c: Docstring edit

	* drawmmenu.c: Move RelieveRectangle into xmisc.c

	* events.c: Use new ConstrainSize() args; better debugging for
	  HandleConfigureRequest()

	* face.c: doc string changes

	* makefile.cassowary: rebuild extratags when TAGS changes

	* module-interface.c: Doc comment fixes

	* move.h, move.c: Added MapMessageWindow(), UnmapMessageWindow();
	  clean up some I18N support and added a ComputeTextWidth function
	  (FIXGJB: maybe this should go in xmisc.c?);  Improve
	  DisplayMessage;  Use move_size of 10 in Keyboard_shortcuts()
	  instead of menu entry height (which was completely broken
	  anyway, and I removed Scr.EntryHeight from the struct
	  ScreenInfo in screen.h

	* placement.c: typographical changes -- I hate spaces between
	  function name and parameter list! :-)

	* resize.h, resize.c: Better encapsulate ConstrainSize, resizing: drop all
	  the file-static variables that manage the resize operation.
	  Added opaque resizing, dropped DoResize (and with it the
	  rubberband -- I'll bring the rubberband back, soon, as I imagine
	  people w/ slower machines [like me at home] want this);  Got
	  resizing working with Cassowary; Added
	  ComputeNewGeometryOnResize to enclose the constrain size stuff;
	  further improve CreateMessageWindow.

	* scwm-snarf.h: Added SCWM_SYMBOL, SCWM_GLOBAL_SYMBOL macros which
	  currently just pass along to SCM_??_SYMBOL macros

	* screen.h: Rename SizeWindow -> MsgWindow.  Drop SizStringWidth
	  and EntryHeight since these are no longer used

	* scwm-constraints.h, scwm-constraints.c: Added x,y args to
	  SuggestSizeWindowTo since resizing to the left involves moving,
	  too.  Call AddSizeConstraints on a new window;  make
	  SuggestMoveWindowTo check to make sure the window really moved
	  before calling XMoveWindow.

	* scwm-constraints.hpp: Added AddSizeConstraints(); make
	  CopyStateToPswVars return two bools, fMoved, fResized; better
	  debugging -- added a _name member to SWCI

	* scwm.c: reorder some initialization stuff to be a bit safer,
	  drop last arg from CreateMessageWindow since MWMMenus flag was
	  unused by it

	* xmisc.c, xmisc.h: Added FXGetWindowSize, RelieveRectangle (move
	  from drawmenu.c, since the message window needed the code)

	* window.h, window.c: Added SetScwmWindowGeometry to resize and
	  move a window properly.  Added select-window-interactively
	  (takes a prompt), generalize the size and pointer window into a
	  message window, and rename appropriately.

	* dbug_resize.h: Added for tracing the resize operations

1998-07-24  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Added screen.c, screen.x

	* face.c: Fix the layout of the Face Specification flags concept

	* move.c, scwm.c (InitVariables): Use msg_window_* not size_window_*

	* screen.c: Rename size_window_* fields to msg_window_*

	* constraint-primitives.cc: Added ResizePswToCurrentSize

	* scwm.c: Added scmScreen object, and initialize it to be the SMOB
	for the global Scr. Init Scr.size_window_{fg,bg}. Call
	init_screen. Use new name CreateMessageWindow() not
	CreateSizeDisplayWindow().

	* color.h: Added SAFE_XCOLOR_OR_{WHITE,BLACK} macros

	* icons.c, borders.c, borders.h, drawmenu.c: use SetGCFg, new
 	version of NewFontAndColor that takes a GC as the first argument.

	* resize.c, move.c: Rename CreateSizeDisplayWindow to
	CreateMessageWindow, and rewrite DisplaySize and DisplayPosition
	to use new DisplayMessage() that just puts a string in the window.

	* xmisc.c (SetGCColors): Added, along with SetGCFg, SetGCBg

	* window.c (ResizePswToCurrentSize): Added this function

	* screen.c: Wrap ScreenInfo in a SMOB so marking of the SCM member
	fields works (this was a long-time latent bug)

1998-07-23  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xproperty.c: Add parens to disambiguate (a>>2+1) [(a>>2)+1]

	* xmisc.h: include X11/Xlib.h

	* window.[ch]: remove unused vars, use cassowary interface on move-to
	primitive, eliminate the move_finalize -- it seems unnecessary,
	move interactive_resize into resize.c

	* virtual.c: Added prototype for RemoveRubberbandOutline(), remove
	MoveOutline proto

	* shutdown.h: Added missing prototype for run_startup_hook

	* shutdown.c: Replace dead assignment which forced the core dump
	with a function call so we're sure that the code doesn't get
	optimized away through dead code elimination.

	* scwm.c: Re-checked all the header dependencies. Moved CreateGCs
	here, added call to init_resize, move out the code that creates
	the size & position display window to CreateSizeDisplayWindow function

	* scwm-constraints.hpp: Added return type for AddStays.

	* scwm-constraints.{cc,h}: Added CassowaryEditSize(),
	SuggestSizeWindowTo(), and rename CassowaryEndEditPosition() to
	just CassowaryEEndEdit().

	* screen.h: Added size_window_{font,fg,bg} for controlling the
	size and position window (shown during interactive moves)

	* resize.[ch]: modularize better -- make globals file static
	instead. move interactive_resize primitive here, and add
	resize.x.  Added CreateSizeDisplayWindow(), added primitive
	set-size-and-pos-window-attributes.  Factor out
	InitializeOutlineRects() and use it

	* placement.c: Removed massive #if 0 from Maciej's rewrite -- it
	was too long, and is in the repo anyway.

	* move.[ch]: Added abstraction MapSizePositionWindow(), drop
	fAddWindow parameter from moveLoop, and document it better, added
	RedrawOutlineAtNewPosition() and RemoveRubberbandOutline()
	functions to make code more clear, and clean up moveLop fn.  Use
	Scr.size_window_font for DisplayPosition() fn.  Clean up InteractiveMove()

	* module-interface.h: Added missing prototype for BroadcastMiniIcon

	* miscprocs.c: Added scwm-path-prefix and scwm-path-exec-prefix

	* makefile.cassowary: Added extratags target so that cassowary
	source files get tags built, too

	* font.[ch]: Make str_fixed global. Clean up menu_font_update so it
	does not mess with the size/position window

	* menuitem.c, draw-menu.[ch], draw-pie-menu.c: Rename scwmmenu.h for inclusion

	* constraint-primitives.cc: Use a list, not a vector for
	rgpswDirty, use DBUG, not scwm_msg for independent variables.

	* colors.c, colors.h: Move CreateGCs() into scwm.c, since it is an
	initialization routine

	* xmisc.c, icons.c, decor.c, callbacks.c, borders.c: Fix warnings, clean
 	comments, remove unused vars

	* add_window.c: Added add_window.x, remove unused vars, give
	simple SuggestSizeWindowTo function for non-cassowary code

	* Makefile.am (scwmpaths.h): Added writing of SCWM_PREFIX and
	SCWM_EXEC_PREFIX #defines.

	* Makefile.am: Added scm_init_func.h target, using new script
	generate_scm_init_funcs.  Alphabetize scwm_SOURCES var.  Separate
	out guile_snarfs from BUILT_SOURCES.  Update for scwmmenu->menu
	name change. Added add_window.x, resize.x.

	* generate_scm_init_funcs: Added this script to be used by the
	makefile for generating the new scm_init_funcs.h file, included by
	scwm.c to declare protoes for all the init_MODULE functions so we
	do not *have* to include header files for just those functions.

	* menu.c, menu.h: Renamed from scwmmenu.c, scwmmenu.h for
	consistency, so new scm_init_funcs.h works as it should (declaring
	the prototypes for all the init_MODULE functions)

	* menuitem.c, scwmmenu.c, xproperty.c (mark_XXXX): Don't guard
	marking subobjects with if (SCM_GC8MARKP(XX)) since the parent
	object will already be marked in newer snapshots of guile.

1998-07-23  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny1-20.ix.netcom.com>

	* callbacks.c: Replace "Timer" with "Input" in the input hook
	concept documentation (whoops).

1998-07-22  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* events.c (HandleScwmExec): Fixed a couple little problems that
	may not have immediately been show stoppers -- now last_offset +=
	(nitems * (form_ret/8)).  Also added more troubleshooting code so
	that it doesn't just fail silently, and point  at
	doc/scwmexec.proto as additional documentation.  Added
	reset-scwmexec-protocol primitive as a just-in-case to avoid
	restarting X server.

	* *.c: Fixed purpose strings (one line sentences
 	at start of procedures), corrected spelling mistakes

1998-07-21  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny3-18.ix.netcom.com>

	* events.c (HandleScwmExec): Examined this function. I could not
	find a problem, but added many explanatory comments.

1998-07-21  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm-constraints.h: Update proto for
	CassowarySetCValuesAndSolve, add proto for CassowaryNewWindow

	* scwm-constraints.cc: Add extra arg to
	CassowarySetCValuesAndSolve, honour it, and also don't call
	resolve and endEdit() if there are no editVars (i.e., no changes
	to the window's position or size)

	* miscprocs.c: Add period to docstring

	* placement.c, borders.c: Send extra arg to
	CassowarySetCValuesAndSolve.

	* add_window.c: Added second param to CassowarySetCValuesAndSolve,
	a bool to tell whether should solve (or just set the values).
	Added CassowaryNewWindow hook to permit adding the stay
	constraints in at the right time.

	* window.c, window.h: Add COPY_BOOL_OR_ERROR and
	COPY_INVERT_BOOL_OR_ERROR macro, and use throughout for error
	checking in primitives that do simple assignment of a boolean to a
	C variable (simplifies a bunch of primitives)

	* miscprocs.c: Fix misuse of flag formal in
	set_smart_placement_is_really_smart_x

	* binding.c, miscprocs.c: fix mismatches between c func name and
	primitive name, as warning by extract-docs

	* module-interface.c: quote "M_ICONIFY" in the comment docstring
	since it is not an argument.

	* miscprocs.c, scwmmenu.c, scwm.c, xproperty.c: document arguments
 	that weren't documented before (extract-docs now warns about these
 	cases)

	* window.c: Added FUNC_NAME to the window-icon-title primitive;
	be sure to use FUNC_NAME pervasively -- extract-docs will warn if
	it's missing

Tue Jul 21 15:01:46 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* constraint-primitives.cc: Remove the obsoleted hard-coded sample
	constraint-creation primitives, keep-to-left-of and
	keep-tops-even, since that can now be done from scheme more generally.

1998-07-21  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny4-02.ix.netcom.com>

	* shutdown.c, shutdown.h: Added startup-hook and
	run_startup_hook() function. This is probably not the right place
	for it, but I can't think of a better one at the moment; I don't
	want to start a new file or clutter up scwm.c any further.

	scwm.c: Call run_startup_hook() after all windows are captured.

Tue Jul 21 14:09:11 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* constraint-primitives.cc: Added window-clv-{x,y,width,height} to
	get at the constraint variable objects.  Don't call addVar in the
	obsoleted functions-- it's redundant with using the
	add-stays-on-window primitive.

	* scwm-constraints.hpp: Added scheme objects to hold the
	ClVariable-s attached to the window.

	* scwm.c: Use protos for the two cassowary functions I need,
	instead of including whole header files

Tue Jul 21 10:38:35 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm-constraints.hpp: Add psolver argument to AddStays, add
	Psw() memfn, CopyStateToPswVars() memfn

	* scwm-constraints.cc: guard everything with if (!psolver), and do
	a regular move window in SuggestMoveWindowTo if !psolver, since if
	there is a psolver, its callbacks result in moving the window

	* constraint-primitives.h: extern "C" sandwich

	* constraint-primitives.cc: extern "C" protect inclusions of
	scwm-proper files scwm.h, window.h.  Added ScwmClvChanged and
	ScwmResolve callbacks, to manage the new rgpswDirty container so
	windows only move once when any of their settings change.  Set the
	callbacks in scwm_set_master_solver

Tue Jul 21 10:30:43 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c (MovePswToCurrentPosition): Make ScwmWindow * a const
	ScwmWindow.

1998-07-20  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny5-21.ix.netcom.com>

	* callbacks.c (run_input_hooks): Make sure port is still open
	before checking if it has characters ready. I could have sworn I
	made this change already (it is definitely there for
	force_new_input_hooks). Am I on crack, or did it somehow get
	reverted?

1998-07-20  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@localhost.localdomain>

	* add_window.c (AddWindow): Removed pointless debugging message.

	* module-interface.c (marshal_fvwm2_iconify_info): Added new
	primitive `marshal-fvwm2-iconify-info'. This procedure constructs
	the contents of an M_ICONIFY fvwm module packet for WIN and
	returns it as a Scheme string.

	* add_window.c, window.c: Use the new BroadcastMiniIcon

	* module-interface.c (BroadcastMiniIcon): Added BroadcastMiniIcon
	and a broadcast-mini-icon-hook. I've simplified it to only take
	(and pass) the window structure; I figure Scheme code can do the
	marshalling out of that.

	* image.c (image_properties): Added 'pixmap and 'mask properties
	to image-properties return value. These are needed for the
	fvwm-module stuff, and could be useful for communicating with
	other X programs as well.

	* color.c (hilight_foreground, hilight_background): New primitives
	hilight-foreground and hilight-background which get the foreground
	and background colors in the current decor. Needed for fvwm-module
	stuff, and probably generally useful.

	* window.c (window_icon_title, window_icon, window_mini_icon):
	Added new primitives window-icon-title, window-icon and
	window-mini-icon to get the icon title, icon image and mini-icon
	of a window respectively. Needed for fvwm-module stuff, and
	probably generally useful.

Mon Jul 20 18:03:11 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm-constraints.cc, constraint-primitives.cc: renamed from .c,
	since they are C++ code

	* Makefile.am: removed the above files, and
	constraint-primitives.x from mention

	* makefile.cassowary: added -- use `make -f makefile.cassowary
	scwm_cl' to build after running configure with
	--with-cassowary=/path/to/cassowary

	* scwm-constraints.hpp: added -- the c++ header file for
	scwm-constraints.cc; this gets included by
	constraints-primitives.cc, but not by the rest of scwm.

	* utilities/dev/extract-docs: improved, added more warnings --
	you should run extract-docs on your souce files from now on to at
	least get warnings (some very useful for diagnosing problems with
	the source code, not just the comments)

	* window.h: go back to simply embedding frame_{x,y,width,height},
	but add a pointer to an opaque ScwmWindowConstraintInfo
	unconditionally (this will be replaced by whatever window
	extension mechanism comes into existence)

	* scwm.c: do not define a global solver object

	* scwm-constraints.h: Do not use ScwmClVariables any longer --
	simplify accessing cassowary from scwm into a simple interface and
	stub those functions.  #define SET_CVALUE for use when assigning
	values to constrained vars (vars which are shadowed by
	constrained variables)

	* window.c, add_window.c, borders.c placement.c, move.c: use the
 	new cleaner interface from scwm-constraints.h -- reduces #ifdef
 	USE_CASSOWARY a lot!  add_window.c has the empty stubs for the
 	prototypes that may be turned into real hooks later.

	* system.h: do not use new and delete unless __cplusplus is
	defined and USE_CASSOWARY is defined (nothing uses this now)

	* image.c: fix a warning due to a constness bug in guile

Mon Jul 20 15:03:39 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* events.c (HandleScwmExec): Fixed long-time probable bug that I
	just noticed for the first time-- last_offset was being increased
	by last_offset+1, instead of just being incremented.  I'm not sure
	of the purpose of the loop, or of the protocol in general, but the
	code looked wrong, and my fix gets things working for me again.

Mon Jul 20 14:24:13 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* binding.c, color.c, deskpage.c, image.c, miscprocs.c,
 	scwmmenu.c: Update some comments based on warnings reported by new
 	additions to extract-docs.  All unquoted all-caps words should
 	refer to arguments -- I change NOTE: to Note: or to a FIXGJB,
 	FIXMS comment -- the latter still produce warnings in
 	extract-comments, but it's a good thing!


	* scwm.c: Move InitVariables() and InternUsefulAtoms() up to the
 	top, and remove their prototypes.  Inline SetRCDefaults() since it
 	was short and not a useful abstraction.  Move MappedNotOverride()
 	to before CapturaAllWindows(), and make it static.  Move
 	LoadDefaultLeftButton, LoadDefaultRightButton, LoadDefaultButton,
 	ResetAllButtons into face.c.  Move DestroyScwmWindow,
 	InitScwmDecor into decor.c

	* face.c: Moved Button faces into here from scwm.c (see above)

	* decor.c: Moved fns from scwm.c into here & made static.

	* screen.h: remove some obsoleted prototypes.


Mon Jul 20 13:43:51 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* *.c, *.h: Replace _XA_ atom names with XA_ atom names, since
 	_UPPERCASE is res'd for impl.

	* *.c: Use #define FUNC_NAME, #undef FUNC_NAME to bracket
 	primitives, and use FUNC_NAME within the primitive -- error
 	handling code gets cut and pasted a lot, and an
 	incorrectly-specified function name could be really annoying to
 	track down.  extract-docs checks the #define -- we could automate
 	instead, but that would slow compile times more, and require an
 	extra build step

	* Fixed a couple of doc strings that were mis-commented, added a
	couple for primitives that were missing doc strings

	* window.c (print_window): Print the windows name along with its id.

1998-07-20  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@localhost.localdomain>

	* add_window.c (AddWindow): Add an explanatory comment.

	* window.c (set_icon_x): Broadcast the new icon filename.

Sun Jul 19 14:18:48 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xproperty.c, window.c, scwmmenu.c, image.c, font.c, color.c,
	xproperty.c:  use MAKE_SMOBFUNS and REGISTER_SCWMSMOBFUNS macros.
	Move the registration of the smob to *before* and of the objects
	are created (these were lurking bugs)

	* decor.h, decor.c: fix bugs in mark_decor -- was marking
	not-yet-constructed objects (maybe this is a missing
	SCM_DEFER_INTS, but this fix works and is safer)

	* scwm.h: make GC_MARK_SCM_IF_SET also check for scm == 0 and not
	mark that

1998-07-19  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@localhost.localdomain>

	* xproperty.c: Documented all concepts and primitives.

	* window.c: Documented all primitives, concepts and hook. Ouch!

	* shutdown.c: Documented all primitives and hooks.

1998-07-18  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@localhost.localdomain>

	* module-interface.c: Documented all primitives and hooks.

	* miscprocs.c: Documented all primitives.

	* image.c: Documented all primitives, concepts and variables. Did
	not document image-not-found-hook; it should be changed to a
	proper hook, and possibly eliminated as it is somewhat redundant
	with error-hook. Or else there should be a warning-hook that it
	should be redundant with.

	* font.c: Documented all primitives and concepts.

	* face.c: Documented all primitives, hooks and
	concepts.

	* events.c: Documented all primitives, hooks and
	concepts. Continuing the FXDOC convention.

	* callbacks.c: Use FIXDOC comments to indicate changes that I
	think are needed for the docstring comment format, or things I
	don't know about it yet.

Sat Jul 18 16:26:11 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scmtypes.h, scmtypes.c: Removed -- now individual init functions do the
	right thing

	* window.c, scwmmenu.c, menuitem.c, face.c, decor.c: Add smob type
	initialization code using the below macros to obviate the need for
	scmtypes.{h,c}

	* scwm.h: Added MAKE_SMBFUNS and REGISTER_SCWMSMOBFUNS macros that
	should be used more consistently

	* scwm.c: Remove call to init_scwm_types, don't include scmtypes.h
	any longer

Sat Jul 18 11:15:59 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* *.c, *.h: Use #ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H to guard #include config.h,
	and use those three lines pervasively (most header files were
	missing the #includes-- can be a subtle bug if you're not on your
	toes [I was caught flat-footed this past week]).

	* decor.c, events.c, module-interface.c, placement.c, window.c,
 	window.h, xproperty.c: Replaced all uses of SCWMWINDOW macro with
 	PSWFROMSCMWIN since that is a less ambiguous name, and makes more
 	sense given the pervasive use of the psw tag througout.  Commented
 	out SCWMWINDOW macro definition so it can be used no longer.

1998-07-18  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny2-05.ix.netcom.com>

	* add_window.c: Documented all hooks.

	* deskpage.c: Documented all primitives and concepts.

1998-07-17  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny3-16.ix.netcom.com>

	* decor.c: Documented all primitives and concepts.

	* color.c: Documented all primitives and concepts.

	* callbacks.c: Documented all primitives, hooks and concepts.

Fri Jul 17 18:46:18 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am, scwm-constraints.c: Added scwm_constraints.c

	* scwm-constraints.h: Added more functional ScwmClVariable, with
	pointer to enclosing _psw

	* window.h, window.c (MovePswToCurrentPosition): Added; made move_finalize static.

	* constraint-primitives.c: add keep_to_left_of,
	add_stays_on_window primitives, better debugging

	* add_window.c (AddWindow): attach ScwmClVariable-s to the psw w/ set_psw

	* move.c (moveLoop): Use cassowary's beginEdit, resolve, endEdit construct

Fri Jul 17 13:33:17 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* all-files: Eliminate #includes of misc.h (gone), and system.h
	(#included by scwm.h now);  add #includes of other headers as now needed

	* borders.h: Move HILITE macros here, and turn them into an enum

	* xmisc.c, xmisc.h: XGetPointerWindowOffsets renamed ->
	FXGetPointerWindowOffsets, XGetWindowTopLeft renamed ->
	FXGetWindowTopLeft

	* misc.c, misc.h: Removed; functions dispersed as appropriate,
	often into xmisc.c

	* Makefile.am: updated to reflect removal of misc.c, misc.h and
	rename of constraint-primitives.cc -> .c

Thu Jul 16 16:19:38 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* module-interface.c, xmisc.c, constraints.h: include <config.h>

	* constraint-primitives.c: return SCM_UNSPECIFIED

	* add_window.c (AddWindow): Better constraints debugging support
	-- give the variables a reasonable name

	* menuitem.c, scwmmenu.c: Use SCM_UNDEFINED to end gh_list call

	* window.c (DestroyScwmWindow): Fix memory leak -- XFree is now
	called on psw->name before deallocating psw.

	* binding.c (FKeyToKeysymModifiers): Fix bug in handling of
	uppercase single keystrokes (e.g., C-M-S-E) -- the keysym that was
	looked for was the uppercase keystroke, which isn't bound to any
	key -- use tolower to convert.

1998-07-16  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* all: Use FREE and NEW instead of free and malloc, use FREEC
	and NEWC for free and new w/ counts of objects (for arrays), and use
	FREECPP and NEWCPP and FREECPPC and NEWCPPC for C++ style memory
	allocations w/ ctr invocations.  Fix some bugs by the removal of the
	cast of old malloc calls' return values.


	* all: Use FRAME_{X,Y,HEIGHT,WIDTH} macros to access the rvalue of the
	window geometry -- does the right thing based on USE_CASSOWARY

	* system.c: Make safemalloc really call calloc

	* system.h: Define new memory management macros
	FREE,NEW,FREEC,NEWC,FREECPP,NEWCPP,FREECPPC,NEWCPPC

	* window.h: Use ScwmClVariable's for frame_{x,y,width,height}, added
	PSWFROMWIN macro

	* icons.c, placement.c, util.c, virtual.c, window.c: Rename some temporaries to psw

	* scwm.c: add global solver variable.

	* borders.h, borders.c: Added two new args to SetupFrame, and define
	bool constants WAS_MOVED,NOT_MOVED, WAS_RESIZED,NOT_RESIZED to set them

	* Fix a couple of memory leaks

1998-07-16  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny5-44.ix.netcom.com>

	* add_window.c (AddWindow): Replace a call to ResetAllFlags with
	ResetCommonFlags to avoid clobbering the fTransient bit (and
	probably other stuff). D'oh!

1998-07-15  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny2-12.ix.netcom.com>

	* placement.c (PlaceWindow): Use user-defined placement
	functions. In particular, if the window is transient, use the
	'transient-placement-proc object property, if not, use the
	'placement-proc property. If the appropriate property is not set,
	use default_transient_placement_proc or default_placement_proc
	which do what scwm used to do, i.e. what fvwm2 would do. Gravity
	is not properly respected at all now, regardless of the border
	width, but I know how to fix this. Will do so soon. There is a
	separate property for transient window placement, because it is
	almost always desirable to place transient windows according to a
	different algorithm than regular top-level windows. In particular,
	ICCCM reccomends that transient windows always be placed exactly
	where requested by the program, without user interaction. Users
	will rarely want to override this behavior.

	(default_select_desk): Separated out desk selection into this new
	procedure to make PlaceWindow easier to understand. However, desk
	selection and switching should not happen here, but should
	ultimately be done in the placement functions (as should possible
	viewport selection). This needs to be fixed.

	(smart_place_window, clever_place_window, random_place_window,
	default_placement_proc, default_transient_placement_proc): New
	Scheme primitives for use as window placement functions:
	`smart-place-window', `clever-place-window',
	`random-place-window', `default-placement-proc' and
	`default-transient-placement-proc'. Each of these takes a single
	window argument. `smart-place-window' has the effect of fvwm's
	SmartPlacement with SmartPlacementIsReallySmart off;
	clever-place-window has that effect as if
	SmartPlacementIsReallySmart were on. random-place-window

	Other Scheme-level procedures which may be useful in user-defined
	placement procedures include `ineractive-move', `move-to' and
	`interactive-resize'. Each of these should work properly.

	(init_placement): Initialize the placement module.

	* placement.h: Prototype init_placement().

	* Makefile.am: build placement.x

	* scwm.c (scwm_main): Initialize the placement module.

	* window.c (window_transient_for): New Scheme primitive
	`window-transient-for'. This takes a single window argument WIN
	which defaults to the window context in the usual way. If WIN is
	transient, and the window it is transient for is not the root
	window and is being managed by scwm, return the window object of
	the window that WIN is transient for, otherwise return #f.

	* miscprocs.c (capturing_p): Added a Scheme primitive `capturing?'
	that determines whether or not we are currently intially capturing
	or recapturing the windows (via the poorly name PPositionOverride
	global variable). When this is true, it is desirable to avoid user
	interaction or other black magic when placing windows.

	* add_window.c (AddWindow): Call PlaceWindow much later, after the
	frame and all attendant windows have already been set up.

Tue Jul 14 16:24:19 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* scwm.c (scwm_main): Make sure scwm initialization happens in the
 	root module rather than the new (user) module, to work around a
 	bug in scm_sysintern. Thanks to Mikael Djurfeldt
 	<mdj@nada.kth.se>.

1998-07-13  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny5-15.ix.netcom.com>

	* syscompat.h: Remove extraneous semicolons.

	* guile-compat.h: If the 3-argument version of scm_make_vector is
	in effect, define a macro that defines the 2-arg version in terms
	of the 3-arg.

	font.c, color.c, image.c: Use the 2-arg version of scm_make_vector
	always.

Mon Jul 13 15:20:11 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* callbacks.c: Use limits.h and LONG_MAX instead of values.h and
 	MAXLONG; as Perry E. Metzger <perry@piermont.com> reported, this
 	is the POSIX way of doing things, and thus more portable.

1998-07-10  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c (DeferExecution): Clean up of DeferExecution, inspired
	by Harvey Stein's latest complaint about the bugs related to it.
	Still could use more work, but better than before for me, it
	seems.


Fri Jul 10 10:45:31 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* events.c (XNextEvent_orTimeout: Remove the #ifdef _hpux, it's
 	unnecessary, and an evil system-test macro anyway. Thanks to
 	Stephen Tell <tell@cs.unc.edu>.

	* syscompat.c: #define setlinebuf in terms of setvbuf or
 	(approximating) setbuf. Based on a patch from Stephen Tell
 	<tell@cs.unc.edu>.

1998-07-08  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* color.c, shutdown.c: fixed arguments that didn't match argument
	list numbers for req, opt, var (extract-docs found these bugs!)

	* *.c, *.h: Rename swCurrent to pswCurrent, use psw for locat
	ScwmWindow * variables.

	* window.c: fix a couple of bugs noticed by Dale Smith -- wasn't
	assigning to psw before testing for return value in
	frame_id_to_window and id_to_window.

	* drawmenu.c: Added a tiny multibyte patch from ITANI Eiichiro.

	* events.c: Use DBUG not WARN for the hook-call messages

	* menuitem.c (menuitem_properties): use SCM_EOL, not SCM_UNDEFINED
	to end a list.  Added documentation for the primitives.

	* *.c: Added #include <config.h> to files that were missing it


1998-07-07  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* *.c, *.h: Rename to SCWM_DEFINE_HOOK, instead of DEFINE_HOOK

	* binding.c: Added comments for primitives, in an extractable
	format.  See utilities/dev/extract-docs for prototype extractor.
	Also added example /**CONCEPT:  ... */ documentation comment to be
	woven into a section on concepts

Mon Jul  6 19:53:46 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* miscprocs.c: Fixed SCWM_PROC macro for
 	set_smart_placement_is_really_smart_x (was not getting snarfed
 	properly).

1998-07-06  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Added decor.x to $(BUILT_SOURCES)

	* scwm.c decor.c: #include decor.x, and call init_decor()

	* scwm.h: #include "scwm-snarf.h"

	* *.c: Use SCWM_PROC instead of SCM_PROC

Mon Jul  6 02:49:08 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* events.c (HandleButtonPress, HandleKeyPress): replace
 	call_thunk_with_message_handler with scwm_safe_call0. I don't
 	believe anyone is using the (deprecated) symbol-dereferencing
 	functionality of the former, and the added safety of the latter is
 	a good thing.

	* add_window.c, borders.c, decor.c, drawmenu.c, events.c, font.c,
 	font.h, icons.c, misc.h, move.c, resize.c, scwm.c, scwmmenu.h :
 	Multibyte character set support from ITANI Eiichiro
 	<emu@ceres.dti.ne.jp>. Some of these changes should be reviewed,
 	but they build and work both ways.

	* window.c: Rename window-from-window-id to id->window and make it
 	ensure that we really are looking up by only the window id and not
 	various decoration ids. Also added frame-id->window primitive.

Sun Jul  5 23:13:06 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* window.c (restack_windows): Added new primitive restack-windows
 	which takes a single argument, a list of windows. The windows will
 	be restacked in the following manner: the first will be left in
 	its current position in the stacking order, and the following
 	windows will be restacked immediately below it, in
 	order. Currently this is of limited usefulness, since it is
 	impossible to introspect the stacking order from the Scheme level,
 	but this will soon be remedied.

1998-07-05  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Mark SCM_SYMBOL and SCWM_PROC macros for etags.

	* color.c, color.h : Use SCWM_PROC throughout for primitives,
 	remove argument from getter functions, e.g., menu_hilight_factor,
	shadow_factor, etc.

	* scwm.h: Added #define of XSERVER_MAX_BUTTONS instead of
	MAX_BUTTONS -- use cMouseButtons instead, as that gets initialized
	by init_pointer_mapping().

	* scwm.c (scwm_main): Call init_pointer_mapping() at startup.

	* scwm-snarf.h: Added, #defines SCWM_PROC macro that reduces
	redundancy a bit more than SCM_PROC, using the s_ symbol name
	prefix that scwm uses by convention

	* events.c (HandleMappingNotify): Call init_pointer_mapping().

	* binding.c (x_pointer_mapping): Added this function, added
	init_pointer_mapping, and added cMouseButtons and
	rgmapMouseButtons vars for providing access to the mouse pointer
	mapping (and number of mouse buttons)

	* binding.h: added proto for above, plus the EXTERN macros

1998-07-04  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* move.c, placement.c, window.c, window.h: Add and use
	invalid-interaction-hook and cannot-grab-hook instead of just
	ringing bell -- those can then call (beep)

	* binding.c: move SCM_PROC for s_mouse_event_type to before function

	* shutdown.c (restart): Rename variable char *n to sz

	* events.h, events.c (HandleMappingNotify): Added this function to
 	recall init_modifiers(), and a new hook X-MappingNotify-hook

	* binding.c: add mod-mask-{meta,alt,hyper,super} primitives for
	testing whether the mod-mask is available; make init_modifiers
	reset the static variables so modifiers that get removed are reset

1998-07-04  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xmisc.c (PNewXTextPropertyFromSz): Added this function to create
	a new XTextProperty struct for the set-window-text-property primitive

	* shutdown.c: Make Done dump core if first arg is < 0, so SegV's
	still give a core dump.

	* events.c (HandlePropertyNotify): Add Robert Bihlmeyer's
	mid-April patch to provide property notification hook.  Added
	passing the window as the second argument, and change named of
	hook to X-PropertyNotify-hook (lowercase "h" for consistency);
	use FXWindowAccessible() instead of XGetGeometry w/ all dummies.

	* deskpage.c: fix one line's indent

	* callbacks.c callbacks.h: Added scwm_safe_call2, call2_hooks for
 	convenience, #include <assert.h>, factor out the WarnBadHook(SCM)
 	code, fix bugs in resetting the hook -- use SCM_SETCDR instead of
 	SCM_SETCAR to SCM_EOL

	* misc.h, misc.c, scwm.h, scwm.c: Move scwm_msg from misc into
	scwm, since it should be available everywhere

	* Makefile.am: build xproperty

	* xproperty.c, xproperty.h: Added from mid-April from Robert
	Bihlmeyer.  Extended the print smob function to display the
	strings value if the property's type is a string.  Also added
	set-window-text-property primitive.

Fri Jul  3 17:44:06 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am:

	* Remove scmprocs.c -- no longer needed since guile-snarf is used pervasively.

	* Added remaining .x files that are now generated by guile-snarf

	* Added noinst_HEADERS, so that tags get built correctly

	* Rename BUILT_SOURCES to pkgdata_DATA since the all target
 	definitely should not depend on the snarfed sources, and automake
 	isn't smart enough to not put $(BUILT_SOURCES) in the dependence
 	for the Makefile even if $(BUILT_SOURCES) is in the
 	OMIT_DEPENDENCIES variable

	* Put pkgdata_DATA in CLEANFILES so the .x files get removed on a
 	make clean.

Fri Jul  2 15:24:22 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* All .[ch] files: Lots of software-engineering changes, many to
	make scwm compile cleanly under the more stringent type-checking
	of C++:
		o Use SCM_PROC pervasively throughout -- this adds a couple .x files,
		and eliminates scmprocs.[ch]
		o Added appropriate init_MODULE functions, and moved some existing
		ones to the very end of the .c file
		o Fix unsigned int vs. int usage so the code type checks for C++
		o Fix unsigned char * vs. char * usage so the code type checks for C++
		o Put casts back in for the returned values from safemalloc for C++
		o Added XGetWindowTopLeft, fixed XGetPointerWindowOffsets, use them
		instead of XQueryPointer with dummy arguments in client code
		o Fix uses of enum-s that were really broken (e.g., functions in
		window.h) -- C++ is a lot pickier about enum-s, and the code was using
		an enum type to hold a bit vector, really.  Now bit-vectors are done
		using an int, and the enum just declares the symbolic constants.
		o Rename formal tmp_win to sw in a couple places
		o Use, e.g., SCMW_H__ not _SCWM_ for multiple inclusion prevention --
		_Caps is reserved for implementation, officially

1998-06-29  Robert Bihlmeyer  <e9426626@stud2.tuwien.ac.at>

	* scwm.c (scwm_main): Handle SIGSEGV.

	* binding.c: If a unbound modifier is given, issue more consistent
 	error messages.

	* events.c (send_key_press): Ditto.

1998-06-26  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny1-21.ix.netcom.com>

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in: Add GUILE_INCLUDES to INCLUDES

1998-06-26  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny1-17.ix.netcom.com>

	* guile-compat.h: Don't prototype scm_parse path if
	HAVE_SCM_INTERNAL_PARSE_PATH is defined, in which case it will
	have a different prototype.

1998-06-26  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny1-21.ix.netcom.com>

	* colors.c (nocolor): Throw an error when we fail to allocate a
	color in a gradient. Not the best solution, but it beats
	segfaulting.

	* callbacks.c (force_new_input_hooks): Check if an input hook's
	port is still open before attempting to check if it has characters
	ready; this was causing severe problems for fvwm modules.

1998-06-23  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny1-07.ix.netcom.com>

	* callbacks.c (force_new_input_hooks): Don't compare the result of
	gh_memq to SCM_BOOL_T, compare for inequality with SCM_BOOL_F!

	* guile-compat.h: add a define for gh_memq as scm_memq when not
	already defined.

1998-06-22  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny2-11.ix.netcom.com>

	* scwm.c: Use scm_internal_parse_path instead of scm_parse_path.

	guile-compat.h: If we don't have scm_internal_parse_path, #define
	it as scm_parse_path.

1998-06-21  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@localhost.localdomain>

	* Grab.h, ICCCM.h, callbacks.h, errors.h, font.h, image.h,
	scmprocs.h, scmtypes.h, string_token.h, system.h, guile-compat.c,
	guile-compat.h, syscompat.c, syscompat.h: Add copyright notice,
	GPL licensing terms.

	* Grab.c, ICCCM.c, callbacks.c, errors.c, font.c, image.c,
	scmprocs.c, scmtypes.c, string_token.c, system.c: Remove GPL
	exception for the FVWM license; RMS claims there is no
	incompatability.

1998-06-20  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny5-15.ix.netcom.com>

	* scwm.c: Always use getopt_long, never use the previous hack to
	simulate it.

	* getopt.c, getopt1.c, getopt.h: Copied from glibc. rms says the
	GPL is compatible with fvwm's license, so there should be no
	problem. This beats maintaining the hack non-getopt_long hack for
	argument parsing. The files are already nicely set up for
	conditional inclusion.

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.am: build getopt.c, getopt1.c

1998-06-20  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny5-14.ix.netcom.com>

	* callbacks.c, callbacks.h: Move input hooks here. add_input_hook
	renamed to add_input_hook_x, now returns a hook handle to be used
	with remove_input_hook_x. remove_input_hook_x
	added. run_input_hooks no longer removes triggered input hooks;
	this seems like a more reasonable semantics. Further,
	add_input_hook_x now accepts an inpput file port rather than a
	file descriptor, and the input hook system ensures that the hook
	is invoked until either char-ready? is not true of the port, or
	the hook has been removed.

	events.c, scmprocs.c: Input hook stuff removed from here.

1998-06-19  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny3-25.ix.netcom.com>

	* syscompat.c, syscompat.h: Move functions that may or may not be
	in libc here. Also rename sleep_ms to usleep.

	string_token.c, string_token.h, system.c, system.h, misc.h: Remove
	the above mentioned functions.

	binding.c, complex.c, events.c, misc.c, move.c, scwm.c,
	scwmmenu.c, shutdown.c, virtual.c: include syscompat.h, replace
	calls to sleep_ms with usleep.

	Makefile.am, Makefile.in: compile syscompat.c

	* scwm.c: Remove call to GetFdWidth (no longer useful or
	necessary).

	system.c: Remove GetFdWidth.

1998-06-19  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@localhost.localdomain>

	* misc.h: Remove conditional includes of sun_headers.h and
	alpha_header.h, autoconf should take care of this type of stuff.

	sun_headers.h, alpha_header.h: Removed.

1998-06-18  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny5-14.ix.netcom.com>

	* Makefile.am: Don't depend on having the `-n' option to `echo'
	when building init_scheme_string.c.

	Makefile.in: regenerated.

	* guile-compat.c, guile-compat.h, callbacks.c, menuitem.c: Restore
	guile 1.2 compatability; provide implementations of
	scm_internal_cwdr and scm_internal_stack_catch if needed, and use
	the compatabilty stuff throughout. Bug reported by Dale Smith
	<dale.smith@bellhow.com>

1998-06-18    Maciej Stachowiak <maciej@roc-ny5-07.ix.netcom.com>

	* shutdown.c: Separate the part of Done() that calls the restart
	command into run_restart_command(); also fixed it to make restart
	behave more reasonably. If no argument, or the argument "scwm" is
	given, it restarts scwm with the exact arguments it was given,
	plus `-s', otherwise, it executes the exact string given using
	`/bin/sh'. Bugs in previous version reported by Dale Smith
	<dale.smith@bellhow.com>

Sat Jun 13 02:51:44 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* guile-compat.c, guile-compat.h: New files; compatability
 	#defines and functions for guile 1.2 all moved here from numerous
 	files.

Thu Jun 11 02:54:09 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* callbacks.c: Error handling much improved; error messages should
 	now include backtrace and source file, line number and column.

Wed Jun 10 21:38:09 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* events.c, scwm.h: Use scm_internal_select in place of select for
 	the main event loop when available; this should make scwm work
 	with guile threads.

Mon Jun  1 19:20:20 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: regenerated with automake 1.3

	* events.c, events.h: Actually compute the highest file descriptor
 	used + 1, instead of using a system maximum. Apparently the old
 	way causes the program to eat CPU under FreeBSD. Bug report and
 	patch from Chris Toshok <toshok@hungry.com>.

Sun Apr  5 14:01:50 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am: List .x files in BUILT_SOURCES rather than lisiting
 	dependencies on them explicitly. Make scwmpaths.h depend on
 	config.status instead of Makefile. Suggestions from Tom Tromey
 	<tromey@cygnus.com>.

	Makefile.in: regenerated.

Fri Apr  3 11:43:28 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Fixed typo: s/fonts./font./g

	Makefile.in: Regenerated.

Thu Apr  2 16:21:32 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* image.c, scwm.c: include "scwmpaths.h"
	miscprocs.c, scw.c: don't include "../version.h"

	These changes are to work with the new automake-based build system
 	(see the top-level ChangeLog).

Mon Mar 30 01:41:21 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* callbacks.c: Fixed bug in run_timed_out_timers() - was failing
 	to break out of the loop that runs the timers.

	* callbacks.c, callbacks,h, events.c: Added support for timer
 	hooks. This involved adding several procedures for managing the
 	timer hook list: shortest_timer_timeout, update_timer_hooks and
 	run_timed_out_timers, some changes to the event loop, and these
 	scheme primitives:

	add-timer-hook! USEC PROC - schedule a call of procedure PROC with
 	no arguments to occur after about USEC microseconds have elapsed
 	(it may take somewhat longer if there are many x evebts to
 	process). Return a handle suitable to be passed to
 	remove-timer-hook!

	remove-timer-hook! HANDLE - remove the specified timer hook from
 	the hook list, preventing it from being invoked if it hasn't been
 	already.

Sun Mar 29 18:10:45 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* shutdown.c, shutdown.h: Files with shutdown handling for scwm,
 	moved from scwm.c, and implementations of restart and quit from
 	miscprocs.c. Features added are making the argument to restart
 	optional (defaults to whatever scwm was run as) and adding a
 	shutdown-hook using the new functionality.

	scwm.c, scwm.h, miscprocs.c, miscprocs.h, scmprocs.c: remove stuff
 	reimplemented above.

	Makefile.in: compile shutdown.c, generate shutdown.x.

	* add_window.c: Remove a bit more dead code from AddWindow().

	* binding.c, binding.h, scmprocs.c: Remove bind-event.

	* add_window.c, add_window.h: Use new-style hook support for new
 	window hooks; add-hook! should now be used with the
 	before-new-window-hook and after-new-window-hook hooks.

	scwm.c: call init_add_window.

Sun Mar 29 14:38:25 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* misc.h, lots of other files: clean up tons of prototypes, move
 	to appropriate files

	* placement.h: Added, for protos for placement.c

	* add_window.c: Call XGetGeometryCacheIt(..) to fix the bug where
	window positions were forgotten every-other "restart" of scwm;
	apparently the X server needs to be queried as to the geometry of
	the windows in order to get this right

	* misc.c: Added XGetGeometryCacheIt(..),
	XGetGeometryPositionOnly(..), rename "restart" variable to
	"fRestart" so it doesn't shadow the global fn named restart(..)

	* miscprocs.c: Use SCM_BOOL_FromBool, instead of ternary
	expression

	* placement.c: Move GetGravityOffsets() to the top and make it
	static since it's only used in this file

Sun Mar 29 13:38:24 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* misc.c: simplify code for return value of GrabEm()

	* scwmmenu.c: Commented out the attempt to send XK_Right;
	XPutBackKeystrokeEvent seems to be working, now, though, but the
	menu still doesn't deal with the keystroke event properly.

	* window.c: Simplify DeferExecution -- it's now only used by
	select_window, and it's still buggy (when used with scwmexec)

Sun Mar 29 11:01:49 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* borders.c: use SHOW_TITLE_P, instead of just checking fTitle --
	this handles decorate transients better, as they might have fTitle
	set, but fDecorateTransient not set and be a transient window;
	Also changed SetupFrame(..) a bit to make it more clear what is
	happening (replaced uses of title_height by new variable
	button_width when they conceptually were the decoration button
	width [which we choose to be the title_height so the buttons are
	square])

	* decorations.c: Use SHOW_TITLE_P, see above note.

	* misc.c, misc.h: Added FXWindowAccessible(..) to abstract the oft-used
	XGetGeometry calls used only for their error return value;
	presumably this is just checking whether the window exists and can
	be accessed.

	* miscprocs.c: Comment the RESOLUTION macro

	* scmprocs.c, window.c, window.h: Added transient? primitive,
	added CopySetAllFlags(..), added SHOW_TITLE_P macro for testing
	whether a title should be visible

	* scwm.c: Clean up some of the startup code -- moved the XSync in
	CaptureAllWindows into just the recapture case -- the main startup
	code does an XSync anyway.  Added some commented out
	XDeleteProperty-s;  not sure if these are necessary, but my gut
	feeling was that we want to return the Server to a cleaner state.

	* scwmmenu.c: Make keyboard shortcuts immediately prepop the next
 	menu, use SCM_BOOL_FromBool(..), Try XPutBackKeystrokeEvent to
 	send a XK_Right to also automatically move the pointer into the
 	newly popped menu item (this doesn't work yet -- I probably need
 	to fill in more fields of the XKeyEvent struct.)

	* binding.c: Use 's' for super modifier, not 'P'

	* add_window.c (AddWindow): Clean up a lot -- always create the
	title windows, since we dynamically can turn them on or off.
	Simplify and comment throughout.

Fri Mar 27 12:26:18 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* module-interface.c: Use new hook interface. The broadcast-hook,
 	broadcast-config-hook and broadcast-name-hook special variables
 	are now expected to contain lists of procedures and may eb
 	manipulated with add-hook!, remove-hook!, etc.

	* callbacks.c, callbacks.h: New system for hooks - allows scwm to
 	set up distinguished Scheme variables that contain a list of
 	procedures to be invoked on certain actions, possibly with
 	arguments. Guile's usual add-hook! macro can be used. So far only
 	used for errors, but will be used throughout soon. For some fun
 	try, with flux.scm loaded:

	(define (message-show-error . args)
	  (message (with-output-to-string
		     (lambda ()
		       (display "scwm error: ")
		       (map (lambda (arg)
			      (write arg)
			      (display " ")) args)
		       (newline)))))

	(add-hook! error-hook message-show-error)

	* events.c: Include callacks.h.

Thu Mar 26 19:04:00 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* add_window.c: Added some comments and debug code

	* scwm.c, binding.h, binding.c: Patch from Robert Bihlmeyer
 	<robbe@orcus.priv.at> to make the modifier keys more ICCCM
 	compliant;  he wrote:

	The following patch puts the modifier masks in variables, which
 	are initialized by a new function `init_modifiers()'. This should
 	be more compliant.

	Scwm will still lose, if the user changes modifiers after it has
 	started. One would have to act accordingly on MappingNotify
 	events; simply calling `init_modifiers()' is not enough, since the
 	now wrong modifier-masks are already stored in the key
 	bindings. So a re-evaluation of these is necessary, which is
 	beyond my understanding of scwm <g>. One could also say: so don't
 	do that.

	* events.c (send_button_press): Fix this function -- it was doing
	nothing because it wasn't filling in x,y and x_root,y_root of the
	synthetic event properly -- it's been broken for a long time, it seems.

	* decorations.c: Reset the fBorder and fTitle to false before
	turning them on again conditionally;  avoids fTitle being
	incorrectly set to True which was causing X errors when transient
	windows popped up since their title window was given an illegal
	height of 0

	* window.c (CopySetCommonFlags): Added this function; simulates
	or-ing in the old bit mask of just the "common" flags

	* window.h: Added proto for CopySetCommonFlags(..)

Thu Mar 26 18:15:59 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* events.c: Fix error redirection to deal with the standard guile
 	error handler - it's necessary to redirect the default error port
 	as well as the current error port. Also remove some dead code from
 	the old scwmsend error handling.

Thu Mar 26 13:59:14 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* misc.h: Removed a bunch of unused #define of FLAG variables from
	window bit field rewrite

	* window.c: Return SCM_UNSPECIFIED instead of SCM_BOOL_T from lots
	of primitives.

Thu Mar 26 07:41:26 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* window.c, window.h, scmprocs.c: Added window-frame-id procedure,
 	needed by the fvwm module stuff and perhaps generally useful.

	* scwm.c, events.c, module-interface.c, image.c: Replace
 	gh_eval_str, load, gh_apply and gh_call1 with new safe
 	versions. Calls to call_thunk_with_message_handler not replaced
 	until I make sure the calls in question are not relying on it's
 	ability to dereference symbols.

	* callbacks.c, callbacks.h: New support for all kinds of callbacks
 	that scwm needs (calling procedures, loading a file, evaluating a
 	string) with proper error handling. The new scwm_safe_apply,
 	scwm_safe_call0, scwm_safe_call1, scwm_safe_load and
 	scwm_safe_eval_str should be better than previous solutions and
 	will be used throughout soon.

	Makefile.in: compile callbacks.c, build callbacks.x.

Wed Mar 25 22:42:42 1998  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Massive rewrite of window flags;  converted from using bitmasks
	to using bit fields.  Gets rid of lots of ugliness due to >32
	flags, and also *really* cleans up all kinds of expressions using
	the flags. Also, added SCM_BOOL_FromBool(bool f) to convert a C
	bool into a SCM_BOOL (instead of idiomatic ternary operator
	expression). Various other less severe clean ups.

	This still may not be the best & final way to do things, but it's
 	far closer, and makes a lot of the boolean guards testing window
 	state a *lot* more readable which will be really important as we
	make more changes.

Wed Mar 25 18:29:12 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* system.c: Remove unused findFile function.

	* color.c: Use gh_number_p, not scm_number_p.

Wed Mar 25 15:01:28 1998  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* drawmenu.c: Set cpixSideImage to 0 when there is no side image

	* color.c: Use SCM_FALSEP(scm_number_p(xxx)), not
	!scm_number_p(xxx) since SCM_BOOL_F still evaluates to "true" as a
	C expression.

Tue Mar 24 15:57:47 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scmprocs.c, miscprocs.c, miscprocs.h: Added
	X-version-information and X-display-information primitives, which
	are needed for FvwmM4 module compatibility, but generally useful
	in their own right

Tue Mar 24 15:14:16 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* miscprocs.c, miscprocs.h, scmprocs.c: Added restarted?
  	primitive, which returns true if this is not an original
 	invocation of scwm, but rather one after a restart. Patch from
 	Robert Bihlmeyer <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

Tue Mar 24 11:05:27 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmmenu.h: Added typedefs and pointers to functions for the
	loadable primitive menu drawing code.

	* scwmmenu.c: Added "construct-menu-primitive" symbol, and use it
	if not #f to call ConstructDynamicMenu(..) so that dynamically
	loaded menu drawing code will be invoked.  This might not be the
	right way to do it -- maybe the dynamic function should be an
	argument to popup-menu, but this is proof of concept, and gives a
	starting place for developing alternative drawing primitives.

	Call the PaintDynamicMenu and PaintMenuItem routines through
	function pointer variables that ConstructDynamicMenu initializes.

	Also, don't complain about a bad menu item if the menu item is #f
	(we use #f to eliminate menu items from a menu when the program
	doesn't exist -- this may be done more cleanly in scheme, perhaps,
	but #f can still be a special case not warranting a warning
	message).

	* font.c (menu_font_update): Added this function to here, from
	drawmenu.c

	* drawmenu.h: Remove protos for everything but
	ConstructDynamicMenu(..) since it is the only loaded primitive
	directly referenced by name.

	* drawmenu.c (ConstructDynamicMenu): Rearrange so this function is
	at the end of the file, and is the only exported function required
	(it sets struct member variables to point to the other functions
	in the interface). Move menu_font_update into font.c, from here.

	* Makefile.in: Rudimentary changes for building shared objects for
	loadable primitives (in the context of menu drawing primitives);
	The options are currently hard set for Linux and gcc, as I'm not
	sure how to do this on other platforms

	* draw-pie-menu.c: Added;  not really pie menus -- just a visually
	different standard fvwm2-like menu;  pie menus will require a bit
	of work, it seems.

Sun Mar 22 11:52:25 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* binding.c (PchModifiersToModmask): Abort binding when we get an
 	unrecognized modifier, instead of binding using the remaining
 	modifiers.  Thanks to <tihonov@ffke-campus-gw.mipt.ru>

	* focus.c (Unfocus): Added function Unfocus() -- should be used
	more pervasively to replace calls to SetFocus with Scr.NoFocusWin
	as first arg.

	* scwm.c (Done): Invert sense of STREQ test in Done() so that all
 	args besides -s are copied into the new argument list; thanks to
 	Robert Bihlmeyer <robbe@orcus.priv.at> for catching this.

	* window.c, window.h: Added unfocus primitive

	* scmprocs.c: Added unfocus primitive

	* focus.h: Added, for protos from focus.c; removed SetFocus()
	proto from misc.h, where it was before.

Sat Mar 21 20:46:35 1998  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* menuitem.h (MENUITEM_P): Test SCM_NIMP(X) first to avoid core dump.

	* scwmmenu.c (NewPchKeysUsed): Just ignore menuitem-s that are #f,
	instead of core dumping.

Sat Mar 21 16:50:57 1998  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* drawmenu.c (ConstructDynamicMenu): Save the side image width in
	pmdi->cpixSideImage

	* scwmmenu.c (popup_menu): Added an optional second argument
	"warp-to-first" that says whether we want to warp to the first
	menu item on popup

	* scwmmenu.c (InitializeDynamicMenu): Fixed bug where keyboard
	shortcuts only worked the first time the menu was popped up

	* scwmmenu.c (MenuInteraction): Added fWarpToFirst argument,
	intended to be passed True from popup-menu (as second arg) when
	bound to a keyboard shortcut;  makes the popped-up menu's first
	item get selected initially

	* scwmmenu.c (WarpPointerToPmiim): Check for null pmiim, and do
	not core dump if is null.

	* scwmmenu.c (SetPopupMenuPositionFromMenuItem): Make left-side
 	menu popups overlap with the side image, if any (instead of being
 	completely to the left of the current menu).

	* drawmenu.c (ConstructDynamicMenu): Save the size of the side
 	image in the MenuDrawingInfo struct.

Fri Mar 20 21:05:39 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Do not use touch to create the .x files before
	running guile-snarf;  guard inclusions of .x files with #ifndef
	SCM_MAGIC_SNARFER

Fri Mar 20 00:33:33 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* miscprocs.c, miscprocs.h, scmprocs.c: Added scwm-version
 	procedure.

	* color.c, color.h: Color object rewrite. The followinf new
 	features are available: colors are properly garbage collected, and
 	are freed when no longer in use. Changing colors a lot will no
 	longer gradually eat your colormap. Procedures to set colors have
 	been split to set one color at a time. And color objects are
 	cached just like image and font objects, so specifying colors by
 	string should provide maximal color object sharing
 	automatically. The following new procedures are available:

	make-color STRING - replaces load-color

	color-properties COLOR - returns the properties of a color object:
 	currently only name and the X pixel value it uses.

	clear-color-cache-entry STRING - clears an entry in the color
 	cache; shouldn't be necessary unless you do something really weird
 	to your X server, but provided for consistency.

	make-relief-color COLOR FACTOR - factor is a floating point number
 	that is multiplied by the color's saturation and luminosity in HLS
 	sppace. This is used with specific factors to

	set-hilight-foreground! COLOR, set-hilight-background! COLOR -
 	these replace set-hilight-colors! FG BG

	set-menu-foreground! COLOR, set-menu-background! COLOR,
 	set-menu-stipple! COLOR - replace set-menu-colors!

	set-hilight-factor! FLOAT - sets the factor that is used by
 	windows with the current decor to generate the relief "hilight"
 	color for the regular and hilight background.

	set-shadow-factor! FLOAT - sets the factor that is used by windows
 	with the current decor to generate the relief "shadow" color for
 	the regular and hilight background.

	hilight-factor, shadow-factor - retrieve the settings of the above
 	two factors from the current decor.]

	set-menu-hilihght-factor! FLOAT, set-menu-shadow-factor! FLOAT,
 	menu-hilight-factor, menu-shadow-factor - analogous to the above
 	but for menus, and are global, not decor-specific.

	All procedures that take a color (except color-properties) will also
 	accept a string that specifies a color.

	window.c: set-window-colors! split into set-window-foreground! and
 	set-window-background!, and converted to use new color system.

	add_window.c, borders.c, decor.c, events.c, face.c, icons.c,
 	module-interface.c, module-interface.h, scmprocs.c, scmptypes.c,
 	screen.h, scwm.c, scwmmenu.c, window.c, window.h: converted to new
 	color system.

	colors.c: Removed GetHilite and GetShadow.

	Makefile.in: generate color.x

Sat Mar 14 01:04:14 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* window.h: Remove or comment out some unused fields of the window
 	structure.

	* screen.h: StdColor and StdRElief members of the ScreenInfo
 	struct are not used anywehere; removed.

Thu Mar 12 20:35:02 1998  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Build init_scheme_string.c use \n\ at ends of
	lines, instead of using a multiline string constant (which vendor
	cc-s don't necessarily support and is not standard C).

	* scwmmenu.c (PmiimFromPmdShortcutKeypress): Remove inline
 	specifier.

	* binding.c (BnumFromSz): Remove inline specifier

Thu Mar 12 00:27:24 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* events.c: Delete the SCWMEXEC_REQUEST property after reading it.

	* miscprocs.c (scwm_version), miscprocs.h, scmprocs.c: New
 	procedure scwm-version, returns a string of the current scwm
 	version.

	* scwm.c, events.c: Remove support for --interactive mode;
 	scwmrepl should now be an adequate replacement.

Wed Mar 11 13:54:02 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* move.c (AnimatedMoveWindow): now handle expose events as we
	animatedly move windows, too (I like the affect from below *that*
	much!)

	* window.c (window_shade): Instead of keeping only expose events
	after doing the window shade, throw out the Resize events; this is
	more precisely the goal, and removes an XSync() call as a result.

	* move.c (AnimatedShadeWindow): handle expose events as we roll up
	the window shade;  much nicer effect in that previously hidden
	windows get redrawn while the shade is still rolling up.

Wed Mar 11 00:10:49 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* events.c: Handle shaded windows that are resized by the app
 	correctly. However, I discovered while fixing this that changing
 	the title height while some windows are shaded loses.

	* scmprocs.c: Remove inclusion of paths.h

Tue Mar 10 22:10:54 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c (window_shade): Fixed bugs w.r.t. not redrawing the
	decorations that get exposed due to an animated window shade (was
	throwing out all events using XSync to avoid processing a resize),
	and regain proper focus after the window shade;  still did not fix
	the bug w.r.t. scwm improperly not disallowing resizes on shaded
	windows.

	* events.c (HandleScwmExec): Fixed warning re: 12 arg's type in
	XGetWindowProperty.

Wed Mar 11 00:10:49 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* scwm.c: Fixed version output (added trailing newline). Bug fix
 	from James Troup <J.J.Troup@scm.brad.ac.uk>

Tue Mar 10 00:32:45 1998  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* image.c (path_expand_image_fname): Call image-not-found-hook if
	it's set to a procedure.  Wrote InvokeHook1, but it's too thin a
	wrapper over gh_call1 right now; also should be in a different file.

Mon Mar  9 23:49:43 1998  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* borders.c (SetBorderX): Eliminate a core-dump in the case that
	an image for a decor is invalid;  this became an issue now that
	I've relaxed the rules for pixmap validity (we now allow missing
	pixmaps to stick around as SCM_BOOL_F)

Mon Mar  9 23:45:40 1998  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* screen.h (GetDecor): GetDecor macro did not need to use the
	cpp stringization operator; removed the `##'

Mon Mar  9 23:31:59 1998  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* image.c (path_expand_image_fname): Use warnings instead of
	scm_wrong_type_arg when we can't find an image file

	* face.c (add_spec_to_face_x): Use warnings instead of
	scm_wrong_type_arg when we can't find an image file


Mon Mar  9 22:50:16 1998  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* drawmenu.c: Inverted the shading of the popup menu item arrow;
	selected now appears pushed in, unselected is reliefed out.

Mon Mar  9 01:41:40 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* events.c: Calculate length for read SCWM_REQUEST property more
 	correctly in HandleScwmExec.

	* events.c(HandleScwmExec): redirect output and error to the
 	requesting program.

	scwm.c, scwm.h: intern atoms for SCWMEXEC_OUTPUT, SCWMEXEC_ERROR.

	* events.c: Use scm_current_error_port, not
 	scm_current_output_port in error handler.

	* events.c: Make HandleScwmExec handle multiple window IDs in the
 	SCWMEXEC_REQWIN property, so clients can use PropModeAppend rather
 	than PropModeReplace.

Fri Mar  6 06:46:20 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* scwm.c (scm_parse_path): Provide if not in libguile.

	* window.c: Fix to smart-placement, patch from Hideki Sakurada
 	<sakurada@kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp>

	* scwm.c (init_scwm_load_path): New function to add the contents
 	of the SCWM_LOAD_PATH environement varibale and the compiled-in
	load path to guile's load path.

Sun Mar  1 02:16:56 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* module-interface.c: Pre-define the broadcast-hook,
 	broadcast-config-hook and broadcast-name-hook variables to #f to
 	make sure they are defined in the root module; also, access them
 	more efficiently by holding pointers to their value rather than
 	doing a gh_lookup each time.

Sat Feb 28 00:57:52 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* module-interface.c (marshal_fvwm2_config_info,
 	init_module_interface): New procedure to generate the data needed
 	to send to fvwm modules on BroadcastConfig, and a new function to
 	initialize stuff.

	module-interface.h: prototypes for the above functions.

	scwm.c: call init_module_interface

	Makefile.in: build module-interface.x

	* events.c: Fixed bug in HandleScwmExec that was causing random
 	crashes - strings should be sent with format 8, not 32, in
 	XGetWindowProperty.

	* events.c: Slight change to HandleScwmExec: don't delete
 	XA_SCWMEXEC_REQUEST properties; it just confuses clients.

Fri Feb 27 18:02:24 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* events.c: Added new procedure HandleScwmExec to handle the new
 	scwmexec protocol. Values should be properly returned to the new
 	scwmexec utility. The old scwmsend protocol is still supported for
 	now, until all the tools that depend on it can be replaced. There
 	is no support for reporting errors back to scwmexec yet, but there
 	should be. ICElib turned out to be to complicated to be useful, so
 	the new solution still uses properties, but in a somewhat saner
 	way.

	scwm.c, scwm.h: declare and intern atoms for the scwmexec
 	protocol.

	* move.c: Fix problem with AnimatedShadeWindow which was making
 	the title bar get clobbered occasionally. Patch from Oleg Tihonov
 	<ost@benetnash.ffke-campus.mipt.ru>

Thu Feb 26 22:00:17 1998  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Rework all the code to make compile using g++, while still
 	remaining C code. Lots of C++ warnings, but no more errors
 	Included renaming window.h's item from class to classhint Adding
 	missing include files (to fix missing function prototypes)
 	Removing duplicate sym_XXXX symbols from miscprocs.c and other *.c
 	files Fixing some missing `return' specifiers of non-void fns
 	Unnesting the vector_coords struct from the ButtonFace struct
 	Adding some #ifdef __cplusplus as needed Reworking access to the
 	`new' memvar of the colormap X object Adding break;'s to switch's
 	empty default cases.

	* scmw.c: Also added some #ifdef USE_CASSOWARY blocks

Wed Feb 25 16:55:29 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* font.c, font.h: Several changes to the font interface. Fonts are
 	now directly Scheme objects; no hacky FontWithInfo struct
 	needed. There is a font cache similar to the image cache. The
 	procedures font-properties and clear-font-cache-entry were added;
 	the former is used to get the font's name and height, the latter
 	to explictly clear entries in the font cache (shouldn't be needed,
 	but you never know). font.c also now uses the SCM_PROC macros and
 	such. Also, load-font was renamed make-font for consistency.

	* borders.c, decor.c, drawmenu.c, drawmenu.h, icons.c, icons.h,
 	miscprocs.c, move.c, resize.c, scmprocs.c, scmtypes.c, screen.h,
 	scwm.c, scwmmenu.c: modified for the new font interface.

	* Makefile.in: build font.x

	* scwm.c: Added scwm_gh_launch_pad and scwm_gh_enter to guarantee
 	proper loading of boot-9.scm once and only once across guile
 	versions. This is a hack until a real solution is available.

Fri Feb 20 03:22:23 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* add_window.c, events.c, icons.c, move.c, placement.c, scmprocs.c
 	virtual.c, window.h: Icon handling fixes and changes:

	Icon geometry has been broken for quite some time, it should be
 	better now.

	The icon settings are now in four procedures:

	set-icon! - sets the requested icon image; if #f, no picture is
 	shown, just the icon title. However, unless force-icon is set, the
 	app icon will take precedence over this setting, so for instance
 	if there is an app icon, it will show up even if this setting is
 	#f.

	set-force-icon! - if #t, the specified icon image or #f indicating
 	no icon image will override the app-provided icon, if any. If #f,
 	the app icon takes precedence.

	set-icon-title! - #t or #f will specify wether the icon title is
 	or is not shown respectively.

	set-show-icon! - just determines wether or not the whole icon is
 	shown at all, without affecting any other settings (so setting it
 	to #f and then back to #t will restore all the original icons).

	* module-interface.c: Broadcast: Provide the num_datum parameter
 	to broadcast hooks.

	* image.c, image.h: Syndry improvements:

	Reorganized image loading - loaders can now be specified by a
 	suffix with more than one dot in it (so ".xpm.gz" works, for
 	instance) and the code is more modular overall.

	Improved cache handling - images are cached by both the requested
 	name and the full path; cache entries may be explicitly cleared
 	with the new clear-image-cache-entry.

	image-properties changed to return an association list - this is
 	more robust against changes in the set of properties returned.

	The new "foreign" field allows pixmaps from outside sources (app
 	icons and the like) to correctly not be freed when the image
 	object is,

Wed Feb  4 23:57:58 1998  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c: Added patch for initialization from Jim Blandy, to
	account for changes in the guile startup code -- fixes the unbound
	variable error.

	* scwmmenu.c: Permit embedded #f's in menu lists, and just ignore
 	them

Tue Jan 27 18:16:28 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* events.c, events.h, scwm.c, scmprocs.c: Added new Scheme
 	procedure add-input-hook and associated support code in the event
 	loop - basically this allows the user to provide an fd to select()
 	on and a thunk to call if input becomes available on the fd. This
 	should be useful for the preliminary fvwm module interface.

Tue Dec 16 15:38:02 1997  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* misc.h, misc.c: Move Destroy, RaiseWindow, LowerWindow, and Unmap into
	window.c, and rename to DestroyScwmWindow, UnmapScwmWindow; move
	HandleHardFocus into events.c

	* errors.c: Removed scwm_error_imm()

	* binding.c: use MAX_BUTTONS, not 3 for highest mouse button
	number

	* add_window.c: remove CLICK_TO_RAISE compile time option ifndefs


Tue Dec 16 14:41:16 1997  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Replace TRUE with True, and FALSE with False

	* scwm.h: Moved ScwmWindow into window.h, moved ColorPair and
	MyFont (renamed to FontWithInfo) into screen.h, other cleanup to
	make smaller since this is included virtually everywhere, move
	binding context macros in binding.h

	* misc.h: remove protos for stuff in virtual.c

	* image.c: No longer warn about pixmap library since I'm not 100%
	sure the depth is supposed to be returned by libXpm

	* virtual.h: added w/ protos of fns in virtual.c

Tue Dec 16 12:41:18 1997  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmmenu.c: Check isascii(keysym) before isgraph(keysym) to
	avoid segfaults on SGI IRIX 5.3 due to out-of-bounds array access

	* string_token.c, string_token.h: Remove stripcpy() as it is no
	longer used.

Fri Dec 12 16:18:48 1997  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Rename COLORP to COLOR_P, and FONTP to FONT_P for consistency
	and readability

	* util.c (call_thunk_with_message_handler): use DEREF_IF_SYMBOL to
	permit 'iconify, e.g.

	* scwmmenu.h: Added DYNAMIC_MENU_P, DYNAMIC_SAFE_MENU,
	MENU_OR_SYMBOL_P, added void *p to MenuDrawingInfo for client
	drawing code to use for extra information, added scmExtraOptions
	to Menu for free-form client options

	* scwmmenu.c: Fixed some memory leaks from not freeing pmdi,
	rgpmiim, etc. when popping down menus -- wrote FreeDynamicMenu to
	do this (if only this were C++!); use SCM_PROC for other
	primitives in here; permit symbols for fonts, colors, and actions,
	and deref them as needed using the new macros; hide some debug
	code in DBUG.

	* scwm.h: Added DEREF_IF_SYMBOL, DYNAMIC_PROCEDURE_P,
	PROCEDURE_OR_SYMBOL_P, RESTP_SCM

	* scwm.c: Use primitive-load instead of load -- MS: is this any
	better?

	* scmprocs.c: Remove gh_new_procedure calls for stuff now done
	with SCM_PROC

	* menuitem.c: use SCM_PROC for other primitives in here; permit
 	symbols for fonts, colors, and actions, and deref them as needed
 	using the new macros.

	* font.h: Added DYNAMIC_FONT_P, DYNAMIC_SAFE_FONT, rename FONT to
	FONT_P

	* font.c: Added warning message when a font cannot be loaded

	* drawmenu.c: Rewrite DrawUnderline, add PxfsFontForMenuItem, use
	DYNAMIC_SAFE_FONT, DYNAMIC_SAFE_COLOR in fixing up the gc;  these
	changes fix the sizing bug (it was using the size of characters in
	fixed font, but then drawing using the selected proportional font)

	* color.h: Added COLOR_OR_SYMBOL_P, DYNAMIC_COLOR_P,
	DYNAMIC_SAFE_COLOR

	* color.c: Added warning message when unable to parse or allocate
	color, and return SCM_BOOL_F in those cases

	* binding.c: Permit symbols using PROCEDURE_OR_SYMBOL_P


Thu Dec  4 18:49:23 1997  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmmenu.c: Lots of changes to the menuing code, including
 	keyboard support, better placement so that menus stay onscreen,
 	cascading menu support, underlined shortcut keys and shortcut key
 	support, more.  Still more configirability and flexibility to be
	added, as well as animation.

	* scwmmenu.h: need fHoverActionInvoked as a DynamiMenu field, not
	as a local variable.

	* string_token.c: fixed forgotten return value in
 	IchIgnoreCaseInSz()

	* borders.h: removed internal functions from the interface

	* drawmenu.c: Be safer drawing menu items to avoid segfault; check
	for scmAction just being set for highlighting, do not require it
	to be gh_procedure_p(), since we know allow actions to be popup
	menu-s again

	* font.h: Add extra parens and SAFE_ versions of casting macros

	* image.c: use scwm_msg, not fprintf, for a debug message

	* menuitem.c: Require that hover_action be a procedure again,
	since cascade popups are now the action object, not the
	hover_action object



Sun Nov 30 13:23:00 1997  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* parse.h: Removed

	* scwm.h: added enum wm_client_functions to replace the few parts
 	of parse.h that were used by check_allowed_function and
 	decorations stuff

	* decorations.c, window.c: renamed check_allowed_function2 to
 	check_allowed_function, since check_allowed_function no longer
 	exists

	* scwm.c: Renamed s_XXXX to szXXXX since they might as well be
 	consistent hungarian tags if they're going to be tag-like

Sun Nov 30 12:25:17 1997  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Use enum cursor for cursors, and prefix the cursor names with CURSOR_

	* Rename Scwm_MenuItem to MenuItem, Scwm_Menu to Menu -- the Scwm_
 	prefixes were just a hack to get around name conflicts with the
 	legacy menuing code. Various parallel renames, as well.

	* window.c: mark the icon_image scm object, make DeferExecution a
 	static fn.

	* drawmenu.c: Tweak some drawing constants a bit, add real
 	separators, make DrawSeparator only take 1 y-coord since it's for
 	horizontal lines

	* image.c: Output images as #<image [name] from [path]>, fix GC
 	code changes from bugs I introduced when I didn't understand the
 	GC idioms.

	* screen.h, misc.h: Moved the cursor types from screen.h into
 	here.

	* screen.h: Removed the name_list * "TheList" since this wasn't
 	used any more

	* scmprocs.c: Rename make-menu-item to make-menuitem,
 	make-scwm-menu to make-menu, remove set-image-path!

	* scwm.h: Fixed precedence problem in UNSET_SCM macro

	* scwmmenu.c: Handle elements in the scmMenuItems list that are
 	not menuitem-s better.  Add menu_init_gcs(), call it from scwm.c


Sat Nov 29 01:09:35 1997  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* menu.c, menu.h, menus.c, menus.h: Removed since menuitem.c,
	menuitem.h, scwmmenu.c, scwmmenu.h, drawmenu.c, drawmenu.h replace
	the functionality these had.  Binding stuff got moved into
	binding.c

	* Picture.c, Picture.h: Removed these, since image.c, image.h
	replaces their functionality.

Fri Nov 28 23:58:30 1997  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* image.c: Added full_name scm string to track where the image
	actually got loaded from.  Use that as it's print string, as I
	think a unique identifier makes more sense than just what the user
	gave to make-image.  image-properties still returns the "name" as
	the car of the list it returns.

	* Move GC_MARK_SCM_IF_SET into scwm.h, and use in image.c.

Fri Nov 28 23:32:18 1997  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* image.c: Adding warnings throughout the imaging code.  I know
 	we've not decided how best to handle warnings, but that doesn't
 	mean that they shouldn't go in the code.
  	scwm_msg(WARN,__FUNCTION__, <msg>) works great, and will be easy
 	to find later when we do something different; Added a note about
 	not finding the max path length every time through... can we do
 	stuff when image-load-path changes? Added a .xpm.gz loader -- does
 	this work?

	* image.h: Added SAFE_IMAGE(x)

	* Makefile.in: Generalize the .x building better; not just for
	image.x any longer

	* Use image.h, not Picture.h for almost everything (except old menu
	code)

	* Use STREQ throughout instead of !strcmp -- I've never liked the
 	latter idiom because of the "!" seems to say not equal

	* Picture.c,Picture.h,paths.c,paths.h: Move szPicturePath into
 	paths.c as szImagePath, though it'll go away real soon now.

	* drawmenu.c: tweak up some of the spacing constants, use images,
 	not pictures. Adding underlining of shortcut keys.  Made
 	PaintMenuItem be external, so that scwmmenu can use it on expose
 	events.

	* icons.c: Removed some legacy code hidden in comments

	* menuitem.c, menuitem.h: Use new GC_MARK_SCM_IF_SET abstraction;
	use images, not pictures. Added menuitem-properties primitive,
	added init_menuitem, use guile-snarf. Added chShortcut,
	ichShortcutOffset, imiim, pmd to MenuItemInMenu objects.  Added
	SAFE_SCWM_MENUITEM caster

	* smprocs.c: update set-image-path!, make-menu-item

	* scwm.c: Added setlinebuf calls for stderr and stdout to ease
 	debugging -- perhaps this is a portability problem.  Also may be
 	an efficiency problem later on, but for now it's the right
	thing. Added new init_... calls

	* scwm.h: Added UNSET_SCM(x) abstraction for variable type checking

	* scwmmenu.c: Use GC_MARK_SCM_IF_SET; use images, not pictures;
	make NewPchKeysUsed store state in the MenuItemInMenu-s; added
	menu-properties primitive; use UNSET_SCM throughout; Got
	hover/unhover hooks working, got popup window behaviour working;
	added numerous menu utility functions; Do highlighting of current
	item properly; use guile-snarf

	* scwmmenu.h: Added SAFE_SCWMMENU; use images, not pictures

	* string_token.c: Added IchIgnoreCaseInSz, and noted that stripcpy
 	can go away when old menuing code goes away

	* xmisc.c: DrawImage now takes a scwm_image * instead of a Picture *


Thu Nov 27 23:37:33 1997  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Augment all OBJECT_P-s with SCM_NIMP(X) test to make sure they
	are safe and remove a ton of duplicated code throughout the whole
	system;  we should *NOT* test, e.g., SCM_NIMP(X) && COLOR_P(X) any
	longer, and the color_p function is simplified to just translating
	between a C bool and a guile boole

	* Added module-interface.h, and include it throughout as needed.

	* icons.c, icons.h: Removed reliance on Picture.[ch].  In the process,
	changed when icon windows get created to when the window is added,
	not when the icon is first used. THIS PROBLEM BROKE SOME ICON
	STUFF, but brief testing shows that things generally work, modulo
	the stuff w.r.t. increased flexibility of user pixmap
	overriding... Also removed some newly dead code there.

	* binding.c: fixed grab key from all window bug -- was grabbing
	keys from all windows even if C_WINDOW bit was not set, and
	unbind-mouse bug -- was not permitting numbers for the button as
	bind-mouse did. Thanks to Oleg Tihonov
	<oleg@benetnash.ffke-campus.mipt.ru> for reporting the problems.
	Also caught a small memory leak.

	* menu.h decor.h: Move #include-s *before* the EXTERN #define,
	since it could cause big problems to include a header file that
	redefined EXTERN before the rest of the .h file

	* font.h, drawmenu.c: don't use SAFE_FONTP, since FONTP now is safe

	* events.c: Replace gh_standard_handler -- bug in guile (?) is
	stopping my new scwm_error_handler from being used to evaluate
	SCWM_PROPERTY messages, but this seems to work and gives slightly
	more useful error messages.  Also removed some szIconFile
	references, and use sw->icon_image, not sw->picIcon

	* image.c: Rename image?-new to image?, added image_properties,
	check depth attribute return value and print a message if it looks
	like Xpm is screwing up (it does for me), added
	make_image_from_pixmap for internal C code.

	* window.c: added window-from-window-id function (needed for
	autoraise, broadcast stuff)


Wed Nov 26 11:07:51 1997  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Do not define away the Broadcast{,Name,Config} functions -- call
 	the ones in module-interface.c, include module-types.h where
 	needed

	* Makefile.in: Stop using $(SHELL) -ec to build dependencies as
 	quoting becomes a burden giving the new complex setting of
 	CFLAGS.... not sure what the ramifications of this are, and I
 	still appear to be getting problems building dependences

	* borders.c: Changed check that had an extra "!" and was causing a
 	dereference of an image that was SCM_BOOL_F.  Fixes my core dump
 	problem.

	* image.c: Rename make-image-new to make-image, and change old
 	make-image back to make-picture (to ultimately be removed)

	* move.c: Remove overshooting target bug in AnimatedWindowShading
	by just stopping once we're at least 100% to the target.

	* scwm.c: init_scheme_string no longer const char *, just char *

Wed Nov 26 00:38:50 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* image.c: Added support for registering a "default" image loader
 	which is used if no loader is registered for the file's extension
 	or if the registered image loader fails.

Tue Nov 25 16:37:01 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* face.c, face.h: Use scheme image objects instead of Picture
 	structs for all images in faces; add mark_face which appropriately
 	gc-marks any referenced images.

	scmtypes.c: Use the new marker function for faces.

	add_window.c: Removed all code that tries to load the mini-icon
 	from a filename, and change AddWindow to expect the tiled pixmap
 	for the border, if any, to be a Scheme image object.

	screen.h: Replaced the p member of the u union in the ButtonFace
 	struct with an image member which is an SCM expected to hold
 	SCM_BOOL_F or an image object.

	scwm.h: Replaced picMiniIcon and szMiniIconFile fields in the
 	ScwmWindow struct with a mini_icon_image field which is an SCM
 	expected to hold SCM_BOOL_F or an image object.

	borders.c: Draw images specified by button/titlebar/border faces
	(including mini-icons) knowing that they are now Scheme image
 	objects.

	window.c: Changed set-mini-icon! to expect and use image objects
 	rather than picture objects. Changed set-icon! to make some effort
 	to remember the icon if it is turned off; this needs more work
 	however.

	* scwm.c: Initialize the new image code.

	* image.c, image.h: Added the init_image_colormap() function; the
 	colormap for images needs to be initialized separately and later
 	than the image code itself; also protect image_loader_hash_table
 	from gc.

Mon Nov 24 14:00:49 1997  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Fixed some dependence problems using image.x file.
  	Added rule to build init_scheme_string.c from
 	../scheme/minimal.scm and link that in with the binary

	* scwm.c: SetRCDefaults() now uses the extern char
	*init_scheme_string from the .c file that the makefile builds.

Mon Nov 24 00:07:05 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Compile image.c; use guile-snarf on it as well to
 	create image.x.

Sun Nov 23 23:59:00 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* image.c: Updated to be able to at least compile; experimentally
 	use the SCM_PROC macro and the guile-snarf program to register new
 	procedures.

Sun Nov 23 17:08:02 1997  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xmisc.[hc]: added DrawImage to abstract drawing of both pixmaps
	and bitmaps.  Perhaps this should be in the new Image.[ch], but
	I'm holding off until that code is in use.

	* drawmenu.[ch]: rework much of the drawing code so that it now
	looks fairly reasonable.  Still need more item spacing, etc., but
	there are more important things to handle before polishing the
	look.

	* face.c, drawmenu.c, scwmmenu.c: remove the checking of
	HAVE_GH_LENGTH -- do this only in scwm.h

	* scwm.h: add above check.

	* menuitem.h: reduce the number of fields in MenuItemInMenu -- use
	more per-menu drawing information in MenuDrawingInfo struct

	* scwmmenu.c: Don't trust drawing code to set correct event mask--
	do it here instead


Sun Nov 23 01:42:37 1997  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* menu-item.h: added some more fields to MenuItemInMenu

	* scwmmenu.c: lots of new code to get drawing of the new menus and
 	popping up to work.  Added popup_menu(). Implementation is not
 	complete.

	* scwmmenu.h:  Added MenuDrawingInfo struct for caching
	information that the drawing code might use.  Changes to the
	DynamicMenu structu

	* scmprocs.c: added popup-menu function, for the new scwm menu
	code

	* scwm.c: call the new init_scwm_menu() [does nothing now]

	* menu-test.scm: Added for testing new menu code

	* colormaps.h: Added, for colormaps.c protos;  use where needed
	throughout;  pull these out of misc.h

	* colormaps.c: fixed protos to be (void) not ()

	* font.[ch]: use FONT_IMPLEMENTATION for file-globals, added
	SAFE_FONTP (perhaps this should be done for all the OBJECTP
	macros)

	* drawmenu.[ch]: Added, for drawing-only (look) code;  partially
	complete implementation of the fvwm menu look

	* xmisc.[ch]: Added for X/Xlib utility functions

	* Makefile.in: updated for above additions


Sun Nov 23 02:47:22 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* image.c: Rewrite of the image code to support: hashed image
 	cache, garbage collection of all images including ones generated
 	by C code, eq?-ness for multiple loads of the same image, ability
 	to register additional image loaders, and image path in the
 	distinguished Scheme variable image-load-path which is interpreted
 	as containing a list of path strings. Basically, everything has
 	been totally rewritten except the low-level image loading calls,
 	which can't be written much differently. This code is not yet
 	integrated into the rest of the program or the build process.

Mon Nov 17 21:07:44 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* string_token.h: Only give prototypes for strcasecmp and
 	strncasecmp if they are not already defined.

	* string_token.c: Only define strcasecmp and strncasecmp if they
 	are not already available.

	* system.c: Changed sleep_ms to use usleep() where available,
 	otherwise fall back to select().

Sat Nov 15 00:18:22 1997  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* menuitem.[ch]:  Added;  the beginnings of an scm object for menu
	items to replace those in menu.[ch]

	* scwmmenu.[ch]: Added; the beginnings of an scm object for menus
	to replace those in menu.[ch]

	* Makefile.in: Include above files in build.

	* system.h: Include config.h and #ifdef out get_hostname prototype
 	if we have the function -- patch from Harald Meland
 	<Harald.Meland@usit.uio.no>

	* gjb.scwmrc: add some commented out test code for new menu items
	and scwm menus.

Wed Nov 12 22:57:31 1997  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c: Added current-window-with-{pointer,focus} functions.
	Abstract out SwFromWindow() instead of using the more obscure
	XContext calls inline.  scmprocs.c updated for new functions.
	Also have a place-holder for select-window-interactively, but it
	does nothing right now.

Wed Nov 12 15:41:28 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* window.c: Fixed the remaining problems with DeferExecution - the
 	event it reads needs to be copied to the global event struct
 	before calling DispatchEvent().

	* scwm.c: Use getopt_long when available for argument parsing,
 	otherwise accept both long and short options by
 	hand-parsing. Patch from James LewisMoss <dres@dimensional.com>,
 	slightly reformated, and changed to provide both long and short
 	options for everything.

Wed Nov 12 00:36:21 1997  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>
	* events.c (HandlePropertyNotify): don't resize shaded windows;
	this improves upon my prior bug fix which had an unfortunate
	timing dependence that I only caught after more testing.
	This should be a reliable fix.

	* Abstracted out SHADED_P, SET_SHADED and SET_UNSHADED, since it's
 	a gross field -- the shaded bit just gets thrown into the buttons
 	field's high-order bit; this should be fixed but not now.

Tue Nov 11 22:14:02 1997  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c: Fix bug with -f "" core dumping, fixed other bugs nearby
	with argument handling.

	* binding.c: Fixed unbind_mouse to respect the context, and ungrab
	the button;  Added A- and H- modifiers for Alt and Hyper,
	respectively.  Abstract out more code to use
	PchModifiersToModmask, and give better error messages.  All mouse
	button numbers to be specified as Mouse{1..3}, etc.; added a
	recapture when the number of buttons w/ defined actions changes.

	* misc.h: more cleanup

	* resize.h, add_window.h, borders.h, colors.h: added for their
	respective implementations, and moved protos out from misc.h

	* add_window.c, borders.c, colors.c : rearranged function order
 	and made local functions static; diffs are pretty unhelpful for
 	these

	* window.c: fixed bug introduced by cut and paste in last update;
	last fix still does not work for me.

	* Updated all includes for the above

Tue Nov 11 18:17:15 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* window.c, window.h, scmprocs.c: Fixed the bug with selecting a
 	window for interactive-move from the root menu. The fix added
 	extra optional arguments to get-window and select-window.

Tue Nov 11 12:49:37 1997  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* binding.c: Use SCM_BOOL_F to report a bad key binding

	* icons.c: Fix bug wrt application icon window; Thanks Andrei
 	Tcherepanov <tandr@ptc.com>.

Mon Nov 10 20:41:21 1997  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* move.c, window.c: Fix AnimatedShadeWindow()'s handling of
 	windows so that it works with Emacs windows; bug was a result of
 	the resizing of the window causing an extra PropertyNotify event,
 	which caused scwm to think that the newly shaded window had been
 	resized, which then makes it call SetupFrame again and re-expose
 	part of the client window.

	* borders.c: cleaned up SetupFrame a bit while tracking down the
	above bug.  Even found an old bug in fvwm2 (of no obvious
	consequence, though).

Mon Nov 10 10:06:59 1997  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* bindings.c: just warn when an unknown keysym is attempted to be
	bound, do not die;  uncommented uses in gjb.scwmrc of the
	only-sometimes-available keysyms KP_XX since now they will only
	produce a warning.

Mon Nov 10 05:17:36 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* decor.c, face.c, Picture.c, system.c, ICCCM.c, Grab.c,
	string_token.c: Added copyright notices.

	* errors.c, errors.h, window.c: Signal an error when the image
 	can't be loaded in set-icon!

	* scmprocs.c: Renamed make-picture to make-image and
 	set-picture-path! to set-image-path! (externally only for now,
 	will change all references in C code soon).

	* miscprocs.c, miscprocs.h, scmprocs.c : Renamed set-xor-value! to
 	set-rubber-band-mask!

Mon Nov 10 00:13:29 1997  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* move.c: wrote AnimatedShadeWindow(), similar to
	AnimatedMoveWindow(); visually not quite perfect, but very nice.
	Inspired by AfterStep's animation (did not look at its code,
	though).

	* move.h: Added this -- protos from move.c, removed from misc.h

	* window.c: give {un-,}window-shade another optional argument -- a
	boolean saying whether we want the (un-)window-shade-ing to be done
	animatedly

	* borders.c: some general cleanup of formatting due to
	automatically removing the #ifdef-s

	* events.c: removed unused macros MAX_NAME_LEN, MAX_ICON_NAME_LEN

Sun Nov  9 14:11:47 1997  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Picture.c, window.c: Handle memory management of strings passed
 	to CachePicture better; gh_scm2newstr()-allocated strings must be
 	freed, so we give them a name.  LoadPicture uses strdup to get its
 	own copy of the filename --this was a bug before, as it might have
 	tried to free a local variable, or might have used memory that was
 	owned
 	(and later modified) by someone else.; free_picture() now calls
 	DestroyPicture before free-ing the scheme object.

	* system.c: Added note about char * return value in findFile --
 	that needs to be freed, too.

Sun Nov  9 07:15:45 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* window.c: Make set-icon! and set-mini-icon! able to take strings
 	as well as pictures to be consistent with the handling of colors
 	and fonts by other functions.

Sun Nov  9 07:15:45 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* face.c: Restore the calls to redraw_borders, since it is now
 	fixed.

	* util.c: Fixed the bug in redraw_borders - it turned out not to
 	be a problem with SetBorderX at all, but rather with some code I
 	mindlessly copied.

	* util.c: Fixed redraw_borders so that it works for now (but is
 	somewhat unattractive).

	* Picture.c, Picture.h, scmtypes.c: Removed mark_picture;
 	scm_mark0 can be used as the marker when no sub-objects need to be
 	marked.

Sun Nov  9 00:00:15 1997  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* icons.c: rearranged and improved the interface specification;
	non-public functions are now static

	* icons.h: added, pulled relevant protos out of misc.h; #include
	it as appropriate

	* menus.c: make LEFT_MENUS be the single version, remove those
	conditionals (fvwm2 menuing code was really broken w/o this
	option); also removed FindPopup() function

	* removed #include "module.h" from all files; remove module.h

	* removed #include "parse.h" from lots of files; still not
	completely unneeded yet

	* scwm.h reduced the redundancy in the ScwmWindow's icon handling; now
	picIcon has all the pixmap information about the icon, instead of
	having everything at the top level of the struct; use macros from
	icons.h to make accessing the new fields not so bad

	* Fixed the bug that prevented the current window from getting the
	focus initially at startup (long-time fvwm2 bug,
	too). CoerceEnterNotifyOnCurrentWindow() is added to misc.c

	* misc.h Still more clean up

	* Fixed the bug that prevented mini-icons from being redrawn once
	they are changed

	* string_token.c: Remove GetNextToken() function; last use of it
 	was obliterated; fixed protos in header to checking MISSING_STRCASECMP

	* Renamed lots of ScwmWindow *tmp_win arguments to *sw.  My
	pet-peeve about variable names is tmp -- all auto variables and
	formals are tmp, so it's redundant.  In this case the short
	Hungarian tag is really nice!

	* Rename the global "Tmp_win" to swCurrent; Tmp_win was a
 	  *terrible* name!; fixed extern refs that use this


Sat Nov  8 20:18:26 1997  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Added picture object; use (make-picture "pic-filename")

	* Combined PixmapPath and IconPath into one variable:
	szPicturePath;  set with set-picture-path!
	[set-{icon,pixmap}-path! have been removed]

	* Permit pixmap arguments to still be strings, but also allow
	pixmap objects.  Improved the caching and sharing is almost
	complete, so little memory is wasted

	* Cleaned up GetXPMFile() to use CachePicture code; these changes
	still are making scwm smaller!  We're under 20klines of commented
	source!

Sat Nov  8 14:54:59 1997  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* misc.[ch]: Lots of cleanup

	* builtins.c: removed from the build

	* Started pixmap/picture re-implementation

Thu Nov  6 10:59:36 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* window.c: Change set-mini-icon! to load the mini-icon file when
 	appropriate. This makes the #:mini-icon style option work.

	* paths.c, Makefile.in, envvar.c: Stop using the code in envvar.c
 	for environment variable expansion in paths and remove it from the
 	build process as well as from the repository.

Wed Nov  5 09:24:21 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* wildcard.c, wildcard.h: Removed because they are not used any
 	more.

	* Makefile.in: Remove wildcard.c from the build process, it's not
 	used any more.

	* add_window.c: Commented out the part of LookInList that scans
 	the style list - there is no style list created anywhere in the
 	code any more so that part of it was never getting executed.

	* miscprocs.c: Change wait-for-window to take a predicate rather
 	than a name string, so we don't have to use matchWildcards. You
 	can pass (wildcard-matcher NAME) to get the old effect (and for
 	that matter, you could just bind the 'new-window event, so
 	wait-for-window will go away entirely sometime).

	* builtins.c: Deleted all the Decor stuff, it is not needed any
 	more.

	* window.c: Added a check that an object passed to a window
 	operation is non-immediate (using the SCM_NIMP macro) before
 	checking if it is a window (using WINDOWP).

Tue Nov  4 11:57:37 1997  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Lots of code cleanup;  integrate the few functions from libs/*
	into the scwm directory. Removed MS_DELETION_COMMENT blocks.
	Added some GJB_DELETION_COMMENT blocks for newly obsoleted code.

Tue Nov  4 13:45:31 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* face.c, face.h: Added scheme-level procedures set-title-face!,
 	set-button-face!, set-button-mwm-flag! and
 	set-border-face!. Changing the border, button and title styles
 	should now be possible, although a higher-level interface still
 	needs to be written. Also, redraws are not done immediately for
 	anything but set-title-face!, because of a bug in
 	SetBorderX. Added appropriate prototypes.

	* util.c, util.h: New function redraw_borders to redraw borders of
 	all windows associated with a decor. However, it doesn't work
 	right now, as SetBorderX appears to be buggy. Added prototype for
 	redraw_borders.

Mon Nov  3 11:20:17 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Further changes that should bring things really close to user
 	face handling; only set-button-face! and friends need to be
 	written now.

	scwm.c: Changes to initialization of the default decor, and
 	decor initialization in general to support the creation of the
 	initial button, border and title faces as Scheme objects

	face.c, face.h: Added creation of the default button, title and
 	border faces as Scheme bjects in the variables
 	default_titlebar_face, default_rbuton_face[],
 	default_lbutton_face[] and default_border_face.

	decor.c, decor.h: Added mark_decor, a new gc marker function that
 	marks all of the face objects associated with a decor object, so
 	garbage collection is happy. Also made make-decor initialize the
 	button, title and border faces from the defaults.

	* colors.c: Changed shadow handling in GetShadow slightly; don't
 	mod by %0xffff any more so very bright colors are not
 	automatically shadowed with black.

Sun Nov  2 00:20:29 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* add_window.c, borders.c, builtins.c, face.c, functions.c,
 	screen.h, scwm.c: Made changes throughout so that ButtonFace
 	structs are only ever used through pointers; this prepares for the
 	change of using scheme face objects everywhere, which in turn
 	should make Scheme access to button, border and title syles
 	feasible.

	* Makefile.in: Added face.c to the build process.

	* scmprocs.c, scmtypes.c, scwm.c, screen.h: Uodated appropriately
 	for face-related procedures, types, initialization, and data

	* face.c, face.h: New files, a start on implementing fvwm's
 	{Button,Border,Title} Styles. For now, face objects (the back end
 	behind fvwm's assorted style commands) can only be created (using
 	make-face) and print and garbage-collect properly. They cannot yet
 	be associated with buttons, titles or borders.

Sat Nov  1 04:44:44 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* events.c: Changed return values of send-button-press and
 	send-key-press from SCM_UNDEFINED to SCM_UNSPECIFIED.

Wed Oct 29 08:41:01 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* scwm.c: Fixed silly bugs in the implementation of the -e and -f
 	options.

Mon Oct 27 06:53:54 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* miscprocs.c: Added support for
 	set-smart-placement-is-really-smart!,
 	set-click-to-focus-passes-click!, set-click-to-focus-raises! and
 	set-mouse-focus-click-raises!. These are obscure, but being able
 	to have click-to-focus without raising the window is nice.

	* events.c: When not raising on click-to-focus, don't raise
 	regardless of where the click comes from.

Sun Oct 26 01:05:27 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* color.c, decor.c, font.c, menu.c, window.c: changed all of the
 	printer functions, print_color, print_decor, print_font,
 	print_menu and print_window to be able to use either the old
	guile printing functions or the new ones.

	* window.c: Use the correct one of gh_vref or gh_vector_ref,
 	depending on what we have.

Sat Oct 25 23:15:40 1997 Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Added send-button-press for synthetic keypress events like GWM

Sun Oct 26 01:05:27 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* scmprocs.c: Eliminate use of gh_new_procedureX_X; instead use
 	gh_new_procedure throughout, since gh_new_procedureX_X will be
 	going away in guile.

Sat Oct 25 21:42:36 1997  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Added extra args to do animated moves to (move-to), also permit
	equivalent movement of the pointer as an option;  added
	AnimatedMoveWindow() to support this, and have it recognize
	"animation-ms-delay" variable; also wrote (set-animation! ..) to
	set the other animation parameters

	* Fix (get-window)/DeferExecution bug

	* Rename sleep_a_little to sleep_ms(), and take ms, not microsecs

	* Updated BUGS, TODO


Fri Oct 24 23:31:54 1997  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Added (unbind-key), (unbind-mouse)

	* Reindent all of the source using indent

	* Clean up all the code so it builds with -Wall, make that the
	default.

	* Fix bugs in key handling -- required a recapture for
	new bindings to be noticed

	* Added gjb.scwmrc, a more full-featured configuration

	* Updated BUGS, added NEEDED (list of features missing)

1997-10-24  Jens-Ulrik Holger Petersen  <petersen@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp>

	* Makefile.in (mostlyclean): New target.
	(LIBS): Use relative directory to "libs/" for VPATH.
	(INCLUDES): Ditto for "include/".

	* deskpage.c (desk_size): Make result consistent with
	`set-desk-size!'.

Thu Oct 23 19:54:16 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Added support for decors as Scheme objects. This includes the
	following changes:

	decor.c, decor.h: new files which implement make-decor, default-decor,
	current-decor, set-current-decor! and set-window-decor!

	scwm.c: wrap the default decor as a nice Scheme object.

	window.c: protect the decor attached to a window from garbage
 	collection in the marker for window.

	scmtypes.c: register the decor type.

	scmprocs.c: register the decor procedures.

	Makefile.in: add decor.c to the build process.

Tue Oct 21 21:03:03 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* window.c: Don't attempt to redraw the border in
 	set-mwm-buttons!; it is now called only on 'new-window-hint, not
 	'new-window because the MWM_BUTTON_FLAG bit clashes with the
 	MAXIMIZE bit.

Mon Oct 20 15:40:48 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* window.c: Changed set-mwm-buttons! to actually set the MWMButton
 	flag, not the MWMBorder flag.

Sat Oct 18 00:04:40 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* miscprocs.c, miscprocs.h, scmprocs.c: Fixed scm-quit to take any
 	number of arguments. Patch from Mikael Djurfeldt <mdj@nada.kth.se>

	* virtual.c: Commented out: changeDesks_func, changeWindowsDesk,
 	scroll, goto_page_func.

	* Makefile.in: Removed bindings.c from the build process.

	* bindings.c: Commented this whole file with #if
 	MS_DELETION_COMMENT

	* window.c: Added another optional argument to get_window which
 	can be used to supress selecting a window.

	Added handling to the interactive-move procedure to start moves in
 	the right place.

	Changed show_titlebar and hide_titlebar to check the current state
 	of the titlebar before asking.

	Added set-lenience! procedure which sets the lenience flag.

Fri Oct 17 19:30:20 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* window.h: Changed header for get_window.

	* scwm.h: Added macros for Broadcast, BroadcastConfig and
 	BroadcastName which do nothing.

	* scwm.c: Commented out several portions of unused code, including
 	the StartupStuff function.

	* windows.c: Commented the whole file; it is gone from the build
 	process.

	* style.c: Commented the whole file; it is gone from the build
 	process.

	* resize.c: Comented out the move_window function, which is no
 	longer used.

	* move.c: Comented out the move_window function, which is no
 	longer used, and fixed InteractiveMove so that moves are started
 	where the motion begins, not where the mouse cursor is when a move
 	is detected.

	* module.c: Commented out the whole file. It is no longer in the
 	build process so this is redundant, but it is a useful reminder.

	* misc.h: Commented out some of the prototypes for module
 	functions; several have been replaced by macros.

	* menus.c: events.c: Commented out some no longer used code with
 	pairs of "#ifdef MS_DELETION_COMMENT" and "#endif /*
 	MS_DELETION_COMMENT */" for easy removal later. Also explicitly
 	undefined MS_DELETION_COMMENT at the top of the file just in
 	case. One deletion is in HandleKey and HandleButton, where
 	ExecuteFunction used to be called. It is no longer possible for
 	flow control to reach this point, and ExecuteFunction no longer
 	exists. Also, the DestroyMenu function was removed.

	* functions.c: Commented out some no longer used code with pairs
 	of "#ifdef MS_DELETION_COMMENT" and "#endif /* MS_DELETION_COMMENT
 	*/" for easy removal later. Also explicitly undefined
 	MS_DELETION_COMMENT at the top of the file just in case. The
 	function ExecuteFunction and most entries in the func_config array
 	were removed.

	* focus.c: Changed SetFocus to correctly handle windows with a
 	focus style of 'none.

	* events.c: Commented out some no longer used code with pairs of
 	"#ifdef MS_DELETION_COMMENT" and "#endif /* MS_DELETION_COMMENT
 	*/" for easy removal later. Also explicitly undefined
 	MS_DELETION_COMMENT at the top of the file just in case. The two
 	deletions are in HandleKey and HandleButton, where ExecuteFunction
 	used to be called. It is no longer possible for flow control to
 	reach those points, and ExecuteFunction no longer exists.

	* complex.c: Commented out a lot of no longer used code with
        pairs of "#ifdef MS_DELETION_COMMENT" and "#endif /*
        MS_DELETION_COMMENT */" for easy removal later. Also explicitly
        undefined MS_DELETION_COMMENT at the top of the file just in
        case. Functions removed are:

        ComplexFunction,expand


	* builtins.c: Commented out a lot of no longer used code with
 	pairs of "#ifdef MS_DELETION_COMMENT" and "#endif /*
 	MS_DELETION_COMMENT */" for easy removal later. Also explicitly
 	undefined MS_DELETION_COMMENT at the top of the file just in
 	case. Functions and variables removed are:

	Maximize, WindowShade, Bell, add_item_to_menu, add_another_item,
 	destroy_menu, add_item_to_func, movecursor, iconify_function,
 	raise_function, lower_function, destroy_function, delete_function,
 	close_function, restart_function, exec_setup, strerror,
 	exec_function, refresh_function, refresh_win_function,
 	stick_function, wait_func, focus_func, warp_func, echo_func,
 	raiselower_func, SetEdgeScroll, SetEdgeResistance,
 	SetColormapFocus, SetClick, SetXOR, SetOpaque, SetDeskSize,
 	setPixmapPath, setIconPath, ModulePath, setModulePath, SetHiColor,
 	SetMenuStyle, LoadIconFont, LoadWindowFont, Circulate, PrevFunc,
 	NextFunc, NoneFunc, WindowIdFunc, module_zapper, Reborder.

	* Makefile.in: Added VPATH support.

	* add_window.c: AddWindow: eplace the call to resize_window with a
 	call to interactive_resize since resize_window is gone now.

	* binding.c: find_mouse_event_type: also store the location of the
 	original event for use by interactive moves.

Thu Oct 16 00:36:06 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Removed read.c, module.c, windows.c and style.c
 	from the build process.

Tue Oct 14 01:13:59 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* window.c: Added many new procedures to support window styles:
 	set-mwm-buttons!, set-mwm-border!, set-icon!, set-mini-icon!,
 	set-hint-override!, set-decorate-transient!, set-mwm-decor-hint!,
 	set-mwm-func-hint!, set-PPosition-hint!, set-OL-decor-hint!,
 	set-start-on-desk!, set-skip-mapping!

	* miscprocs.c: Added Scheme beep procedure which encapsulates
 	XBell.

	* borders.c: Added SetBorderX and redefined SetBorder in terms of
 	it to allow the border and title to be redrawn correcly on
 	interactive options changes.

	* add_window.c: Made several changes to AddWindow to support
 	Scheme callbacks upon the creation of a new window. Specifically,
 	run_new_window_hint_hook and run_new_window_hook are run at the
 	appropriate places.

	* binding.c: Added the 'new-window-hint event to take care of
	some issues relating to creating new windows and the time at
	which hint settings must be available.

Sun Oct  5 16:20:26 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* window.c: Added many new procedures that should be useful for
 	both style purposes, and in some cases also for binding to
 	interactive commands.  The following have been added: keep-on-top,
 	un-keep-on-top, kept-on-top?, show-titlebar, hide-titlebar,
 	titlebar-shown?, normal-border, plain-border, border-normal?,
 	set-border-width!, stick-icon, unstick-icon, icon-sticky?,
 	set-icon-box!, set-window-focus!, set-window-colors! and
 	set-icon-title!.

	* binding.c: Added bind-event procedure to enable binding hooks
 	for special window manager events. Currently, only the 'new-window
 	event is implemented. Also added the run_new_window_hook()
 	procedure for C to let the code that initially decorates a window
 	do this.

	* add_window.c: AddWindow() - changed to call the new window
 	hook. This will enable handling of style options on window
 	startup.

	* events.c: Changed handling of MapNotify event to deal properly
 	with windows that start out iconified.

	* window.c: Implemented select-window. This means that window
 	operations off of root menus and such should be happy.

	* window.c: Renamed get-window-position, get-window-size,
 	get-window-id, get-window-desk, get-window-title and
 	get-window-list to window-position, window-size, window-id,
 	window-desk, window-title and list-all-windows. This change and
 	the ones to deskpage.c and miscproc.c are to provide "Schemier"
 	names before the current ones becomes at all established.

	* deskpage.c: Renamed get-display-size, get-desk-size,
 	get-viewport-position and get-current-desk to display-size,
 	desk-size, viewport-position and current-desk respectively.

	* events.c: Added error handling to callbacks using
 	call_thunk_with_message_handler.

 	callbacks to Scheme code in error handling using
 	call_thunk_with_message_handler.

 	us to handle errors in callback code.

	* window.c: Added get-window-position, get-window-size,
 	get-window-id, get-window-desk, get-window-title and
 	get-window-list procedures. It should now be possible to get more
 	useful info on windows at runtime, and also write "window list"
 	type procedures in Scheme.

Thu Sep 18 01:27:08 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* menu.c: Added a marker for menu objects, so their thunks and
 	submenus don't get GC'd.

	* deskpage.c: New file. Adds procedures set-current-desk!
  	set-viewport-position!, set-edge-scroll!, set-edge-wrap!,
