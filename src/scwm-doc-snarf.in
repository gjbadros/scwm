# Handle snarfs with embedded %/%/ separating the arglist of procedures
# from the rest.
# See scwm-snarf.h for what expands SCWM_PROC macros to what we process here.
# We need to do a couple of regexp search and replaces:
# s/SCM //g
# s/,[ \t]*//g
# s/"(/"'(/g  # add the Scheme quote to the list -- tricky shell quoting below
# AND we need these to only happen *after* the %/%/ marker on the input lines
# so we use two sed's to do it.
