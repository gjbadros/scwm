Just a cleaned up but totally non-functional version of FvwmPager
It's been reindented, and uninteresting code has been removed.
Interface code and drawing stuff still remains.  

The issues that we'll need to resolve are:

o Adding hooks on old module events (i.e., when fvwm2 used to
  talk to a module over the pipe, have each communication
  take place over a hook with the appropriate items);  the module
  docs are probably a reasonable starting specification for this.

o Linking in dynamically-loadable primitives;  need this for
  other stuff too, obviously.

o Allowing events relating to windows created by dynamically-loaded
  C code and/or scheme code to get propagated back to that code;
  this seems related to the problem with handling multiple event loops
  that linking to any GUI interface will introduce

Idea: We should implement something like the below as an experiment!

  Sample hello_world application that is dynamically loaded, is 
brought up, e.g., whenever a window is added, and just adds a simple
top level window;  it also instructs scwm that events pertaining to
that window should go to a specific dispatch routine, or perhaps
a scheme callback.  Clicking in the window could then remove the
window.
