	* window.c: Added many new procedures to support window styles:
 	set-mwm-buttons!, set-mwm-border!, set-icon!, set-mini-icon!,
 	set-hint-override!, set-decorate-transient!, set-mwm-decor-hint!,
 	set-mwm-func-hint!, set-PPosition-hint!, set-OL-decor-hint!,
 	set-start-on-desk!, set-skip-mapping!

	* miscprocs.c: Added Scheme beep procedure which encapsulates
 	XBell.

	* borders.c: Added SetBorderX and redefined SetBorder in terms of
 	it to allow the border and title to be redrawn correcly on
 	interactive options changes.

	* add_window.c: Made several changes to AddWindow to support
 	Scheme callbacks upon the creation of a new window. Specifically,
 	run_new_window_hint_hook and run_new_window_hook are run at the
 	appropriate places.

	* binding.c: Added the 'new-window-hint event to take care of
	some issues relating to creating new windows and the time at
	which hint settings must be available.

	* window.c: Added many new procedures that should be useful for
 	both style purposes, and in some cases also for binding to
 	interactive commands.  The following have been added: keep-on-top,
 	un-keep-on-top, kept-on-top?, show-titlebar, hide-titlebar,
 	titlebar-shown?, normal-border, plain-border, border-normal?,
 	set-border-width!, stick-icon, unstick-icon, icon-sticky?,
 	set-icon-box!, set-window-focus!, set-window-colors! and
 	set-icon-title!.

	* binding.c: Added bind-event procedure to enable binding hooks
 	for special window manager events. Currently, only the 'new-window
 	event is implemented. Also added the run_new_window_hook()
 	procedure for C to let the code that initially decorates a window
 	do this.

	* add_window.c: AddWindow() - changed to call the new window
 	hook. This will enable handling of style options on window
 	startup.

	* events.c: Changed handling of MapNotify event to deal properly
 	with windows that start out iconified.

	* window.c: Implemented select-window. This means that window
 	operations off of root menus and such should be happy.

	* window.c: Renamed get-window-position, get-window-size,
 	get-window-id, get-window-desk, get-window-title and
 	get-window-list to window-position, window-size, window-id,
 	window-desk, window-title and list-all-windows. This change and
 	the ones to deskpage.c and miscproc.c are to provide "Schemier"
 	names before the current ones becomes at all established.

	* deskpage.c: Renamed get-display-size, get-desk-size,
 	get-viewport-position and get-current-desk to display-size,
 	desk-size, viewport-position and current-desk respectively.

	* miscprocs.c: Renamed get-pointer-position to pointer-position.

	* events.c: Added error handling to callbacks using
 	call_thunk_with_message_handler.

	* menus.c: Fixed the use of Scheme submenus, and also wrapped
 	callbacks to Scheme code in error handling using
 	call_thunk_with_message_handler.

	* events.c: Added error handling for key and mouse binding
 	callbacks.

	* menus.c: Added correct handling for submenus and error handling
 	for Scheme callbacks.

	* util.c: Added call_thunk_with_message_handler; this will enable
 	us to handle errors in callback code.

	* window.c: Added get-window-position, get-window-size,
 	get-window-id, get-window-desk, get-window-title and
 	get-window-list procedures. It should now be possible to get more
 	useful info on windows at runtime, and also write "window list"
 	type procedures in Scheme.	

Thu Sep 18 01:27:08 1997  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* menu.c: Added a marker for menu objects, so their thunks and
 	submenus don't get GC'd.

	* Imakefile: Added deskpage.c to the build process.

	* deskpage.c: New file. Adds procedures set-current-desk!
  	set-viewport-position!, set-edge-scroll!, set-edge-wrap!,
 	set-edge-resistance!, set-desk-size!, get-display-size,
 	get-desk-size, get-viewport-position, get-current-desk.
