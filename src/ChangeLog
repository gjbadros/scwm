	* scwm.c, callbacks.c: added -g option to force gc'ing at all c hooks.  Slows
	stuff down nicely for debugging (but is prohibitive on a slow
	machine. 

	* move.c, events.c, binding.h, binding.c: Fix bugs in interactive
 	moves; make sure the click position is where the offsets are
 	calculated from, and discard motion events up to a button press
 	event.

Thu Jan  6 08:45:19 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.inl: Always add the decoration sizes for
	{Min,Max}Frame{Width,Height}.

	* resize.c: Subtract out decoration sizes before doing the base +
	increment computations, but after doing the max/min computations.

Wed Jan  5 15:54:34 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.h: Added some enums for SCWM_NONANT_* to describe whole
	edges for nonant highlighting code.

	* window.c: Added IntFromNonantSymbol(), NonantSymbolFromInt() to
	convert back and forth.  Permit `set-window-highlighted-nonant!'
	to take symbols and return appropriate values from
	`window-highlighted-nonant'. 

	* borders.c: Highlight appropriate sides and corners for the new
 	edge nonant designations.

	* add_window.c: Init psw->highlighted_nonant using
	SCWM_NONANT_NONE instead of its value (-1).

Wed Jan  5 13:51:35 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c (make_window): Set win->schwin and protect answer
	before setting the window valid flag.  (I think it's possible a
	collection could've occurred when making the vector which would've 
	thrown the assertion in mark_window).

	* ChangeLog-1997-1999: Added
