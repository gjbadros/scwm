Mon Jan 10 13:19:46 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xproperty.c, scwm-constraints.hpp, resize.c, placement.c,
 	move.c, module-interface.c, icons.c, focus.c, events.c, events.c,
 	constraint-primitives.cc, color.c, borders.h, borders.c,
 	add_window.c: use SCM_FROM_PSW(psw), not psw->schwin.

	* window.h: Added SCM_FROM_PSW macro/inline function.  Rename
	schwin field of ScwmWindow struct to _schwin to ensure no uses are 
	left.

	* window.c: Added 'bad-interactive-spec error symbol, and use it
 	w/ scm_error when reporting interactive_spec errors.  Fix bad
 	malloc/free bug in ScmArgsFromInteractiveSpec().

	* scwm.c: Added SCWM_DEBUG_MALLOC #define, but leave it off.

	* events.c: Make x_motionnotify_hook have name
	"%X-MotionNotify-hook" for debugging.

	* callbacks.h: Improve SCWM_MAKE_HOOK macro to take a name, too,
	for x_motionnotify_hook.

	* callbacks.c: Use scm_puts, not scwm_msg for debug output in
	scwm_run_hook, print better debug output for call-interactively.

Sun Jan  9 19:01:46 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c: Added fDoneStartup variable, and set it.

	* miscprocs.c: Added `done-startup?' primitive to return above
	var.

	* add_window.c: Fix off-by-one error reported by Harvey Stein in
	the sizes of new windows with titlebars.

Sun Jan  9 17:17:51 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xproperty.c: Fix #define FUNC_NAME mismatch caught by scwmdoc.

	* events.c (HandleKeyEvent): Ungrab the keyboard when we're about
	to do the execution of the commands.  This lets C-S-M-Enter, e.g., 
	still be sent to the application (XTerm, e.g.) even when C-S-M is
	a three-modifier binding that would otherwise wait for the Meta to 
	be released before releasing the passive grab.  Fixs bug reported
	by Stefan Saroui re: C-S-M-Enter in XTerms no longer working since 
	I added the fvwm2-pager auto-raising on C-S-M modifier binding.

	* binding.c: Let `unbind-keycode' take two ignored-proc arguments
	to permit calls that are otherwise identical to `bind-keycode'

Sun Jan  9 16:22:45 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* placement.c: Consistently subtract (psw->old_bw + psw->bw) from
	the final x/y positions for the placement functions.  The various
	fns were all different w.r.t. whether they did this.

	* events.c: Added `X-SelectionNotify-hook', and handle
	SelectionNotify events by calling the hook.  Useful with new
	`X-convert-selection' primitive.

	* xproperty.c: Added `X-convert-selection',
	`X-get-selection-owner'.  Make `X-property-delete!' take an Atom
	or a String, instead of requiring a string.

	* window.h: Fix aliasing of "w" variable bug in
	VALIDATE_ARG_WIN_ROOTSYM_OR_NUM_COPY.

	* window.c (SetScwmWindowGeometry): Correct x/y after using
	ConstrainSize to account for gravity.  No remarkable perceived
	effect:  I'm trying to eliminate the jumpiness of the right edge
	of an East-gravity window when resizing it out to the left (so
	that it's right edge should stay exactly where it is throughout
	the animation)

	* resize.h, resize.c (ComputeDeltaForResizeWithOrigSize): Added
	this function, and rewrote ComputeDeltaForResize in terms of it.
	This permits using something other than the current
	FRAME_WIDTH/FRAME_HEIGHT for the size (as was needed by
	c-animation.c).

Sat Jan  8 17:17:40 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* miscprocs.c: Added `get-next-event' primitive.  Updates docs of
	others to reference it, too.  Maybe should deprecate the
	`get-mouse-event', and `get-key-event' procedures.

	* callbacks.c: Added docs for the this-command{,-args} variables.

	* binding.c: Permit "A-Button2" for mouse bindings (in addition to 
	"A-Mouse2", "A-2").  Make `get-mouse-event' return in the
	"*Button#" format.  Added optional ignored arguments to
	`unbind-mouse' and `unbind-key' to permit invocations of them to
	look just like invocations of `bind-mouse' and `bind-key' (made a
	little bit easier to do some stuff in prompt-binding module, and
	seems harmless).

Fri Jan  7 15:58:13 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* events.c (HandleButtonPress): Use stash_orig_button_position,
	not find_mouse_event_type in the immediate proc.

	* binding.h, binding.c: Added stash_orig_button_position(),
	separated from find_mouse_event_type.

Fri Jan  7 13:41:15 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* callbacks.c (s_call_interactively): Added `pre-command-hook' and 
	`post-command-hook'.  Move `call-interactively' to later in file
	so it can call scwm_run_hook. Added vars "this-command" and
	"this-command-args". 

	* scwm.c (scwm_main): Call init_message_window *after*
	InitVariables() since it relies on some colors in the Scr struct.

Fri Jan  7 10:30:23 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Added scwm-doc-snarf.

Fri Jan  7 09:59:08 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c: Added some debugging code for make-ing and free-ing
	window objects.  print_window now uses sprintf to avoid the
	possibility of GCing (it used to do a gh_ulong2scm w/ scm_write
	which caused problems when calling print_window from within GC
	debugging routines.  Display some debug information when the
	mark_window routine is called with obj != psw->schwin.

	* events.c (HandleButtonPress): Call find_mouse_event_type for the
 	immediate proc, too.  This avoids offset anomalies when using
	C-S-M-2 button to move a window.

	* add_window.c: Fix a terrible race condition for windows that
	don't live very long by invalidating the window before freeing the 
	memory.  This changes corrects the sporadically-reproducible bug I 
	was observing with the GIMP (and maybe others' problems w/
	netscape, too?).

Thu Jan  6 18:04:45 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.c, callbacks.c: added -g option to force gc'ing at all c hooks.  Slows
	stuff down nicely for debugging (but is prohibitive on a slow
	machine. 

	* move.c, events.c, binding.h, binding.c: Fix bugs in interactive
 	moves; make sure the click position is where the offsets are
 	calculated from, and discard motion events up to a button press
 	event.

Thu Jan  6 08:45:19 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.inl: Always add the decoration sizes for
	{Min,Max}Frame{Width,Height}.

	* resize.c: Subtract out decoration sizes before doing the base +
	increment computations, but after doing the max/min computations.

Wed Jan  5 15:54:34 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.h: Added some enums for SCWM_NONANT_* to describe whole
	edges for nonant highlighting code.

	* window.c: Added IntFromNonantSymbol(), NonantSymbolFromInt() to
	convert back and forth.  Permit `set-window-highlighted-nonant!'
	to take symbols and return appropriate values from
	`window-highlighted-nonant'. 

	* borders.c: Highlight appropriate sides and corners for the new
 	edge nonant designations.

	* add_window.c: Init psw->highlighted_nonant using
	SCWM_NONANT_NONE instead of its value (-1).

Wed Jan  5 13:51:35 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* window.c (make_window): Set win->schwin and protect answer
	before setting the window valid flag.  (I think it's possible a
	collection could've occurred when making the vector which would've 
	thrown the assertion in mark_window).

Wed Jan  5 12:38:15 2000  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* ChangeLog-1997-1999: Added
