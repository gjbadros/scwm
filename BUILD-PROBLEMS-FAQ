If you get lots of warnings like the below:
scwm-screen-ci.hpp:41: warning: volatile qualifier ignored on asm

-> fix line 292 of guile-1.3/libguile/__scm.h:
/* should comment out volatile (fixed in newer [unreleased] versions of guile) */

Guile/scwm starts up *really* slowly ( >10 seconds on a PPro200 or
better):

You are missing the tiny patch to guile-1.3 (also available from the web 
page):

Problems building on Redhat 6.0 because there is no guile-config or guile-snarf script?
You need to install the guile-devel rpm -- see scwm web page or just grab it from
a Redhat mirror such as:

ftp://ftp.rge.com/pub/systems/linux/redhat/redhat-6.0/i386/RedHat/RPMS/


Core dump in _IO_setvbug?  You probably have a guile compiled with
glibc2.0, trying to run by dynamically linking against glibc2.1.

If you're on Redhat 6.0, the guile and guile-devel rpms should work fine
with Scwm.  Otherwise, it's probably most prudent to grab the guile-1.3
sources from the Scwm web page, get the local patch and apply it, then
re-build guile and re-install.  Be sure to remove any old installations
of guile, too, or at least be sure that Scwm links against the new build
of guile.



Lots of warnings like:

constraint-primitives.x:2: warning: ANSI C++ prohibits conversion from `(SCM)' to `(...)'

and

color.c:221: warning: passing arg 1 of `gh_str02scm' discards `const' from pointer target type

and

image.c:414: warning: passing arg 1 of `scm_wrong_type_arg' discards `const' from pointer target type

Just ignore them-- they are harmless (the latter can be fixed by adding
const declarations to the prototypes in libguile/error.h).

I have seen this on a stock standard Redhat 5.2, using the scwm RPM from
redhat-contrib.

I solved the problem by grabbing the SRPM file and remaking the RPM file.

This had an annoying conflict with /usr/info/dir, which I (hastily) solved
by using --force and then mv /usr/info/dir.rpmsave /usr/info/dir.
