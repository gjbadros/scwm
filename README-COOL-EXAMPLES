XTerms change title automatically, reflecting a change in appearance due to window-style

Easy font changes C-S-M-Enter, S-M-Enter (actually X-resources do this, but gravity
makes this integrate nicely w/ Scwm)

Programmable placement

Vanishing windows implementation -- autoshrink module

* cn investigator
* visualizations
* composition recorder
* springy-positioning or not (-> add to GUI)
