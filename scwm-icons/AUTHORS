Primary Authors of Scwm
=======================

Greg J. Badros, gjb@cs.washington.edu:
Maciej Stachowiak, mstachow@alum.mit.edu:

Greg and Maciej have worked together on Scwm since Maciej first
converted fvwm2 to use Guile/Scheme as its configuration language in
September of 1997.  Together, they've written, debugged, maintained,
and packaged Scwm over the last two years.  But they could not have done 
it without the support of many, many other folks!
