REPORTING BUGS IN SCWM

Please send bug reports to scwm-discuss@mit.edu.

If you use the scwm-mode for Emacs from utilities/emacs/scwm.el,
please use M-x scwm-bug RET to send a bug report.

If you have build difficulties, or do not use emacs, use the script
./scwm-bug-report-information (included with the distribution in the
top level directory) and mail us that output as well as the below
information.


We want this information:

o build troubles? mention previous successful builds of scwm, if any
  (or tell us if it's your first time building scwm)

o specific description of the bug;  keep in mind the first
  thing we will want to do is reproduce bug, so explicit
  instructions on how to demonstrate the problem are essential.
  This may involve including a .scwmrc file -- if so, please try
  to create a small, self-contained .scwmrc file that isolates
  the essential nature of the problem --- try to not send us your
  whole 2000 line .scwmrc! :-)

o scheme error? be sure to include the scheme backtrace

o core dump? backtrace from gdb or another debugger
  (save the core file in case we can't reproduce it -- gzip it if
   you're short on space)

o image (picture) problems? give us an "ls -l" of pixmap directories


THANKS!
