This is the information we need when someone reports a bug.  We should
have a scheme function which accumulates it and mails it to us, perhaps.
For now, we should just ask for this information all at once; we should
also write this up better for normal users.

We want these:
o guile -v output
o scwm -v output
And any of these you think might be relevant:
o ldd scwm output
o config.h file
o copy of the .scwmrc being used
o env output
o any local changes to the libraries?
o ls -l of pixmap directories
