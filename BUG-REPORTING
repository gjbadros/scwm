If you use the scwm-mode for Emacs from utilities/emacs/scwm.el,
you should send bugs w/ M-x scwm-bug to send a bug report. --08/07/98 gjb

This is the information we need when someone reports a bug.  We should
have a scheme function which accumulates it and mails it to us, perhaps.
For now, we should just ask for this information all at once; we should
also write this up better for normal users.

We want these:
o guile -v output
o scwm -v output
o mention previous successful builds of scwm, if any
  (or tell us if it's your first time building scwm)
o the file: scwm/scwm/changed.c
o the file: scwm/scwm/scwmpaths.h
o scheme backtrace
o backtrace from gdb or another debugger if scwm dumped core
   (save the core file in case we can't reproduce it) --07/21/98 gjb

And any of these you think might be relevant:

o 'ldd scwm' output
o the file: scwm/include/config.h
o copy of the .scwmrc being used, or portion thereof
o 'env' output
o any local changes to the libraries?
o ls -l of pixmap directories
