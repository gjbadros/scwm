Maciej's goals for 0.7:

Definitely:

 (infrastructure:)
 * use automake and libtool, and make use of autoconf more correct
 * fix error/warning system - provide useful error messages (with line
 numbers where feasible), support user hooks for displaying warnings,
 possibly also errors.
 * review menu oddities (visual effects, API)
 * uniform way of doing callbacks - a file of support functions to call
 procedures with 0, 1 or n arguments, evaluate strings, etc. Also
 uniform support for hooks, in particular, make the places where hooks
 are handled (and where it would be appropriate) provide uniform access
 to a list of hooks, with ability to append, prepend, insert and remove
 hooks.
 * organize support code properly (make autoconf testing more regular,
 don't provide copies of stuff that's in the local libc, etc)
 * Clarify copyright/license status of files.

 (features:)
 * improve fvwm legacy module support - make tkgoodstuff work (work with
 Richard A. Guay <guay.thailand@juno.com> on this)
 * guile-gtk support as a test of loadable modules
 * possibly experiment with breaking out some more stuff into loadable
 binary modules
 * fix more bugs

Possibly:

 * Fix modifier key stuff should support Alt, Hyper, Super, Meta
 properly, perhaps also provide physical modifiers
 ("1-","2-","3-","4-") that would map straight to mod1-mod4, ignoring
 the keysyms. Maybe steal from GNU Emacs or XEmacs? RMS claims mixing
 GPL with the old Twm license is kosher...
 * review broadcast and input hooks - improve to the state where the
 latter at least can be documented.
 * Add timer hooks.
 * review add_window.c
 * add getters for some setters
 * placement functions
 * convert to bitfield-style window flags?
 * start on window structure rewrite - window-property interface
 * do some revision of decors and faces?
 * Provide a loadable module that loads images through Rasterman's
 "Imlib" - this supports many image formats natively, supports many
 more non-natively, and dithers images nicely down to a uniform
 colormap shared with other apps.
 * Scheme objects for GCs 

Done:
 * Figure out what's going wrong with window shading.
 * Remove old scwmsend stuff.
 * better scheme wrappers for colors
