	* libmain.c: #include <string.h> for strlen.

Tue Mar 16 08:39:26 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* libmain.c: Use char *, not unsigned char *.  Add the appropriate
 	cast when calling XGetWindowProperty and when returning the value,
 	but let client code not have to deal with unsigned char *'s. Fix
 	bug in scwmexec_exec whereby the result was not returned properly.
  	This was obvious when building with "-Wall -W -pedantic" as all
 	builds should be done, methinks.

	* scwmexec.h: Use char * for args, not unsigned char *.

	* libmain.c (scwmexec_exec_full): Fix race condition-- must select 
	for PropertyChange events before changing the properties!  Added
	$Id$

	* libmain.c: Add copyright notice.

1998-06-18  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny5-14.ix.netcom.com>

	* Makefile.am: Make sure to include X includes.

	Makefile.in: regenerated.

Mon Jun  1 20:28:17 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: regenerated with automake 1.3

Wed Mar 11 21:34:32 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* libmain.c: Deleting the properties while reading them is now
 	safe, thanks to waiting for all three PropertyNotifies, so this is
 	now done.

	* libmain.c: OK, I broke down and made scwmexec_exec_full wait for
 	notification on all three relevant properties. This should avoid
 	the former weirdness. XSync in the server was not helping.

Mon Mar  9 00:45:21 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* libmain.c: Slight change to the event waiting - get all
 	PropertyNotify events for the relevant window, only drop out of
 	the loop when we get the one we care about.

	* libmain.c: Add a new call scwmexec_exec_full which gets the
 	redirected error and output as well as the result. Also, change
 	the way the pproperties are waited for to use XIfEvent; this
 	should prevent other PropertyNotify's from being eaten if this
 	library is used from an X app.

	* libmain.c: Use PropModeAppend when setting SCWMEXEC_REQWIN
 	property; this should make the scwmexec protocol safe against
 	races between multiple clients.

	* libmain.c: Check more thoroughly for SCWMEXEC_LISTENER property.
