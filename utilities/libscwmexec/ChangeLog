	* libmain.c: Slight change to the event waiting - get all
 	PropertyNotify events for the relevant window, only drop out of
 	the loop when we get the one we care about.

	* libmain.c: Add a new call scwmexec_exec_full which gets the
 	redirected error and output as well as the result. Also, change
 	the way the pproperties are waited for to use XIfEvent; this
 	should prevent other PropertyNotify's from being eaten if this
 	library is used from an X app.

	* libmain.c: Use PropModeAppend when setting SCWMEXEC_REQWIN
 	property; this should make the scwmexec protocol safe against
 	races between multiple clients.

	* libmain.c: Check more thoroughly for SCWMEXEC_LISTENER property.
