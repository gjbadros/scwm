Sat Dec  4 12:36:24 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmdoc.in: unescaped escaped quotes in C docstrings, too, now,
	since they are literal strings unlike before (when they were
	comments). 

Fri Dec  3 13:52:18 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmdoc.in: Minimalistic change to statically grab the new-style 
	arg+string comments from primitive headers.  Does not yet use the
	.doc files.

Sun Oct 17 11:00:34 1999    <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmdoc.in: Permit SCWM_[IW]?PROC, not just SCWM_PROC.
	(SCWM_WPROC is not in use yet, but will be soon, probably).

Sat Sep 25 15:19:09 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmdoc.in: Drop an extraneous newline from the
	scwm-procedures.txt output. 

Wed Sep 15 14:00:23 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmdoc.in: Convert #&rest into #&amp;rest.

Sun Aug 22 14:25:30 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_SCRIPTS): Added X-error-describe.

Sat Jul 17 22:24:33 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmdoc.in: Update to scwm.mit.edu.

Fri Jul  2 10:07:07 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmdoc.in: Ignore the word "X11" even though it is all caps
	(i.e., do not require it to match an argument).

Fri Apr 23 17:12:33 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmdoc.in: Added back in -V, -O options, but mark -V as
	  obsoleted (by the preferences support).  -O never should've been 
	  dropped yet.

Thu Apr 15 19:41:23 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmdoc.in: Do not warn about comments unless $fWarnIfNoComment
	(i.e., now -n means turn off comment warnings).  Also, even when
	warning about comments, only print one warning if there is no
	comment (i.e., do not warn about no comment, and about no purpose
	line, and about each formal being missing).

Wed Apr  7 10:38:02 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmdoc.in: Use 'Primitive from (app scwm foo)' for C modules in 
	directory foo/ as the module name.

Fri Apr  2 10:44:42 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmdoc.in: Drop -V, -O options for user-options stuff.  That is 
	now handled by scheme code in preferences and defoption modules.

Tue Mar 30 20:12:19 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmdoc.in: Handle SCWM_VALIDATE-- it is used in code that does
	argument validation but is not an exported primitive (i.e., it
	does not use SCWM_PROC).  It's not perfect, as the list of
	arguments is redundant with the prototype list, but it's better
	than nothing. Also handle ARG_UNUSED(var) and ARG_IGNORE(var) in
	the prototypes -- this changed the matching regex.  And abstract
	out check_arg_name_number_match.  And check arg num/name match for 
	all VALIDATE_* macro invocations, SCWM_WRONG_TYPE_ARG, and
	scm_wrong_type_arg.

Mon Mar 29 15:31:17 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmdoc.in: Permit X_\S+_hook ids to match the C identifier w/o
	regard to case -- eliminates false positive warnings for those hooks.

Thu Mar 25 18:19:43 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmdoc.in: Drop unsupported '-G' option from help.  Added
	accumulation of `define-string-matcher' forms, and
	`add-window-style-option', etc., forms.  Rudimentary support for
	processing these so that they at least appear in the documentation.

Wed Mar 24 19:09:46 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmdoc.in: Shorten the per-procedure information by combining
	Module and Implementation-Notes, and use refsect2 for the new
	subsection so it's smaller.

Wed Mar 24 15:38:25 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmdoc.in: Import doc/src/*.sgml files into the scwm.sgml that
	is created so that the text there can be more easily written.

Wed Mar 24 12:09:02 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmdoc.in: Fix some DocBook problems, added an Introduction
	section for each chapter since the first section gets treated
	specially in the html (it's put at the bottom of the contents for
	that chapter).

Wed Mar 24 11:32:13 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmdoc.in: Simplify the author information.  Use (thunk) for (0 
	args), (1 arg) for (1 args).  Fix -F option handling for by-group
	chapter.  Put by-group synopses chapter before the procedure
	reference.

Mon Mar 22 13:51:01 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmdoc.in: Handle new form of SCWM_HOOK taking extra "num_args" 
	argument.  Fix some SGML id issues that were causing jade
	warnings.  Permit #&allow-other-keys optargs.scm to be replaced
	with #&amp;allow-other-keys propertly.

Fri Mar 19 14:34:11 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmdoc.in: Added -S, -F options for specifying "skip all proc
	chapters" and "Skip all not-starting-with F procs" -- these are
	useful for debugging as generating HTML on the whole of scwm.sgml
	is *really* slow.  Change -d option to take a URL prefix, not a
	directory, and set it to use cvsweb.new's ~checkout~ cgi-bin
	script by default.  Reorder the chapters so the procedure
	documentation is at the end, not at the beginning (people were
	missing the fact that there's more than just the reference manual
	[even if the rest isn't yet very good]).  Add a separate link to
	the CVS log of the files in the "Implementation Notes" section.

1999-02-11  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmdoc.in: Added -P argument for specifying a prefix other than
	SCWM so that it's useful for other packages (specifically, for the
	guile wrapper of the Cassowary library)

Sat Jan 23 16:41:21 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmdoc.in: Check scm_wrong_type_arg and VALIDATE_COLOR lines to
 	ensure that their argument index and argument name match

1998-12-04  Todd Larason  <jtl@molehill.org>

	* scwmdoc.in: fix to display escaped quotes inside C documentation
 	strings properly - patch from Carl Witty

Tue Nov 24 08:15:27 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmdoc.in: Added -H, -N options to output hooks and concepts
	documentation to text files.  Thanks Carl Witty!

Mon Nov 16 22:12:26 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Don't redundantly distribute X-error-describe
 	(automake can do it automatically).

	* extract-docs: renamed to scwmdoc.in

	* extract.scm: renamed to scwmdoc.scm.in

Wed Sep 30 19:08:54 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* scwm-usage-counter.in, X-error-describe.in,
 	create-dependency-dot-graph.in: Add these, which are like the
 	non-.in versions but are templates for ./configure
	
	* scwm-usage-counter, X-error-describe,
 	create-dependency-dot-graph: Remove these from the source tree,
 	they will now be generated by ./configure from the templates.
	
	* extract.scm, extract-docs: Make these into templates for
 	./configure, they will be used to generate scwmdoc and scwmdoc.scm
 	with the right path to the perl or guile interpeter.
