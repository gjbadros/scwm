	* scwm-usage-counter.in, X-error-describe.in,
 	create-dependency-dot-graph.in: Add these, which are like the
 	non-.in versions but are templates for ./configure
	
	* scwm-usage-counter, X-error-describe,
 	create-dependency-dot-graph: Remove these from the source tree,
 	they will now be generated by ./configure from the templates.
	
	* extract.scm, extract-docs: Make these into templates for
 	./configure, they will be used to generate scwmdoc and scwmdoc.scm
 	with the right path to the perl or guile interpeter.
