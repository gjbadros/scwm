Wed Mar 24 12:09:02 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmdoc.in: Fix some DocBook problems, added an Introduction
	section for each chapter since the first section gets treated
	specially in the html (it's put at the bottom of the contents for
	that chapter).

Wed Mar 24 11:32:13 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmdoc.in: Simplify the author information.  Use (thunk) for (0 
	args), (1 arg) for (1 args).  Fix -F option handling for by-group
	chapter.  Put by-group synopses chapter before the procedure
	reference.

Mon Mar 22 13:51:01 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmdoc.in: Handle new form of SCWM_HOOK taking extra "num_args" 
	argument.  Fix some SGML id issues that were causing jade
	warnings.  Permit #&allow-other-keys optargs.scm to be replaced
	with #&amp;allow-other-keys propertly.

Fri Mar 19 14:34:11 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmdoc.in: Added -S, -F options for specifying "skip all proc
	chapters" and "Skip all not-starting-with F procs" -- these are
	useful for debugging as generating HTML on the whole of scwm.sgml
	is *really* slow.  Change -d option to take a URL prefix, not a
	directory, and set it to use cvsweb.new's ~checkout~ cgi-bin
	script by default.  Reorder the chapters so the procedure
	documentation is at the end, not at the beginning (people were
	missing the fact that there's more than just the reference manual
	[even if the rest isn't yet very good]).  Add a separate link to
	the CVS log of the files in the "Implementation Notes" section.

1999-02-11  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmdoc.in: Added -P argument for specifying a prefix other than
	SCWM so that it's useful for other packages (specifically, for the
	guile wrapper of the Cassowary library)

Sat Jan 23 16:41:21 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmdoc.in: Check scm_wrong_type_arg and VALIDATE_COLOR lines to
 	ensure that their argument index and argument name match

1998-12-04  Todd Larason  <jtl@molehill.org>

	* scwmdoc.in: fix to display escaped quotes inside C documentation
 	strings properly - patch from Carl Witty

Tue Nov 24 08:15:27 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmdoc.in: Added -H, -N options to output hooks and concepts
	documentation to text files.  Thanks Carl Witty!

Mon Nov 16 22:12:26 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Don't redundantly distribute X-error-describe
 	(automake can do it automatically).

	* extract-docs: renamed to scwmdoc.in

	* extract.scm: renamed to scwmdoc.scm.in

Wed Sep 30 19:08:54 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* scwm-usage-counter.in, X-error-describe.in,
 	create-dependency-dot-graph.in: Add these, which are like the
 	non-.in versions but are templates for ./configure
	
	* scwm-usage-counter, X-error-describe,
 	create-dependency-dot-graph: Remove these from the source tree,
 	they will now be generated by ./configure from the templates.
	
	* extract.scm, extract-docs: Make these into templates for
 	./configure, they will be used to generate scwmdoc and scwmdoc.scm
 	with the right path to the perl or guile interpeter.
