1999-02-11  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmdoc.in: Added -P argument for specifying a prefix other than
	SCWM so that it's useful for other packages (specifically, for the
	guile wrapper of the Cassowary library)

Sat Jan 23 16:41:21 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmdoc.in: Check scm_wrong_type_arg and VALIDATE_COLOR lines to
 	ensure that their argument index and argument name match

1998-12-04  Todd Larason  <jtl@molehill.org>

	* scwmdoc.in: fix to display escaped quotes inside C documentation
 	strings properly - patch from Carl Witty

Tue Nov 24 08:15:27 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmdoc.in: Added -H, -N options to output hooks and concepts
	documentation to text files.  Thanks Carl Witty!

Mon Nov 16 22:12:26 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Don't redundantly distribute X-error-describe
 	(automake can do it automatically).

	* extract-docs: renamed to scwmdoc.in

	* extract.scm: renamed to scwmdoc.scm.in

Wed Sep 30 19:08:54 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* scwm-usage-counter.in, X-error-describe.in,
 	create-dependency-dot-graph.in: Add these, which are like the
 	non-.in versions but are templates for ./configure
	
	* scwm-usage-counter, X-error-describe,
 	create-dependency-dot-graph: Remove these from the source tree,
 	they will now be generated by ./configure from the templates.
	
	* extract.scm, extract-docs: Make these into templates for
 	./configure, they will be used to generate scwmdoc and scwmdoc.scm
 	with the right path to the perl or guile interpeter.
