Sun Nov 28 14:58:35 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* misc/debian-scwm_menus: Added -- From Francesco Tapparo.  This
	gets put in /etc/X11/scwm/scwm_menus when the scwm*.deb is
	installed.

Fri Oct  1 21:53:46 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* misc/startscwm: expand out $userresources, look for
	~/.Xresources first.

Thu Sep 30 10:48:16 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* pidproperty/scwm_set_pid_property.c: Added -rdynamic to sample
	link line.  This makes it work under x86 RH6 for me.  Also added
	RTLD_NOW flag to dlopen to make it fully link when loaded (instead 
	of lazily).  Added more debugging code.

Tue Sep 28 14:58:26 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* misc/guile-gtk.spec: Update for new version of guile-gtk with
	the bugfix for the preferences support.

Mon Sep 27 08:42:33 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* misc/startscwm:  Fix scwm/scwm to src/scwm.  Try to let
	"display=:1 startscwm" work.  Fix bug in loading of .Xmodmap files 
	-- was referencing un-defined shell variables.

Sun Sep 26 14:06:31 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* run-renamed/Makefile.am:  Change dependence to
	../../src/syscompat.o, not ../../scwm/syscompat.o

Fri Sep 17 12:53:02 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* misc/startscwm: Echo "exit" when Scwm crashes before starting
	xterm so it's easy to cut and paste to remove the xterm and
	restart scwm again (in case the focus policy didn't get reset
	properly).

Thu Sep 16 10:01:15 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* misc/guile.spec: Bump to release 3gjb, take care of readline
	change in repo.

Wed Sep  8 18:18:23 1999  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* misc/startscwm: Make bash-portable by adding missing semicolon
	to complex conditional.  Thanks Ken Pizzini!

Sun Sep  5 16:57:03 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* misc/startscwm: Added some xauth calls to set up .Xauthority
	before running xinit (so my start-x2x script will work).  Changed
	the code from the RedHat startx script.

Sun Sep  5 16:19:38 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* misc/startscwm: Use xinit instead of starting X manually.

Sat Sep  4 15:18:07 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* misc/startscwm: Use XTERM_PROGRAM_NAME instead of just XTERM and 
	setting to xterm. (Still use xterm as default).

Sat Sep  4 00:13:09 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* misc/Makefile.am: Install scwm-conf script.

	* misc/scwm-conf: Added -- just use scwm-exec to run scwm-options-dialog.

Thu Sep  2 15:37:55 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* misc/startscwm: Delay for 3 seconds, not 1.  Use -name for the
	SCWM messages xterm.

Tue Aug 31 23:50:48 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* misc/guile-gtk.spec: Bump release to 2gjb, since it now links
	against guile-1.3.3 (libguile.so.6)

Tue Aug 31 17:39:54 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* misc/guile.spec: Bump to 1.3.3.

Tue Aug 31 17:20:47 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* misc/cpp-sed-nl: Added -P option to suppress "# line" lines
	(resulted in a startup warning).

Tue Aug 31 15:56:41 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* misc/gtk-1.2.4-xshm.patch: Added -- turn off USE_SHM
	compile-time flag since gdkimage.c tries to use it even on remote
	displays.  Waiting for word from gtk-list.


Fri Aug 27 01:15:11 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* misc/Makefile.am (pkgdata_DATA): Include Xsession.

	* misc/Xsession: Added -- patching is not all that reliable, it seems.

Fri Aug 27 00:18:11 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* misc/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Install Xsession.patch,
	Xmodmap-win95keyboard

	* misc/startscwm: Use $HOME/scwm-source as the default SCWMDIR, so 
	we do not pick up $HOME/scwm by accident.  Reorder code to start X 
	server before running xauth

	* misc/guile-gtk.spec: Update %files section

	* misc/Xsession.patch: Use a context diff instead of a unified
	diff
	
	* misc/Xmodmap-win95keyboard: Added.

Thu Aug 26 22:54:01 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* misc/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Include Xsession.patch.

Thu Aug 26 11:34:24 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	files list.

Wed Aug 25 17:32:15 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* misc/startscwm: Make work with no X server running.

Sun Aug 22 14:30:10 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* misc/Makefile.am, misc/Xresources-cpp, misc/Xsession.patch,
	gnome-session-Scwm: Handy files for making Scwm more complete and
	usable.  Still not integrated these files into the build/rpm processes.

Sun Aug 22 14:27:41 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* pidproperty/Makefile.am, pidproperty/Makefile.in.works: Added
 	.am so make dist would work, etc., but Makefile.in.works is the
	only Makefile.in that currently builds the directory's software
	properly. 

Sun Aug 22 14:25:43 1999   Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Added misc subdirectory.

Fri Jul 23 17:53:36 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Only build pidproperty subdir if
	DL_SUPPORT. 

Tue Jul  6 08:49:22 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* run-renamed/Makefile.am: Link w/ ../../scwm/syscompat.o for
	setenv fn.

	* run-renamed/run-renamed.c: include config.h, and remove the
	conditional on existence of setenv() -- instead, have Makefile.am
	link with syscompat.o which provides a definition of setenv for
	all of scwm sources.

Tue Jul  6 08:32:48 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* pidproperty/scwm_set_pid_property.c: Added inclusion of config.h.

Sat Jun 26 14:15:31 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* run-renamed/run-renamed.c: Added NO_SETENV ccd test-- need to
	update configure to provide that macro.

Sun May  9 14:50:01 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* xterm-properties.diff: Added.  Patch to
	http://www.clark.net/pub/dickey/xterm/xterm.html.  Adds a new
	control sequence, "ESC ] 3 ; foo=bar ^G" to set X property foo to
	bar.  "ESC ] 3; foo ^G" deletes property foo.  Integrates with
	property-respond module.


Fri Apr 23 17:16:01 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* dev/scwmdoc.in: Added -O, -V options back in.

Thu Apr 22 20:25:34 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* run-renamed/Makefile.am, run-renamed/run-renamed.c: Added --
 	from Ken Pizzini and my discussion on scwm-discuss.  Permits
 	programmatically changing WM_COMMAND of an X application to embed
 	an identifier to later be used to map back to the execution that
 	started the process that mapped the window.  Similar purpose to
 	pidproperty, but different approach. Credit for the approach goes
 	to Robert Bihlmeyer.

Thu Apr 22 20:07:15 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Added run-renamed directory

Tue Apr 20 20:10:31 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	pidproperty/scwm_set_pid_property.c: Added -- to support 
	`window-pid' primitive.

Thu Apr 22 16:47:43 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* pidproperty/scwm_set_pid_property.c: Factor out some code into a 
	function, and look for SCWM_OTHER_ID environment variable and set
	the X property to the env var's value, if the var is set in the env.

Thu Apr 22 12:59:09 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* pidproperty/Makefile.am.broken: An automake attempt,
	but doesn't work.

Thu Apr 22 12:58:05 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* pidproperty/Makefile.in: Added install targets, make
	work better with automake.

Wed Apr 21 14:34:37 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* pidproperty/Makefile.in: Added clean target for
	recursive builds.

1998-10-27  Sam Steingold  <sds@goems.com>

	* emacs/scwm.el (scwm-documentation): signal an error
	when the source file doesn't exist.

1998-09-27  Todd Larason  <jtl@teeny.molehill.org>

	* dev/extract-docs: 'use Text::Balanced' instead of 'use
	Balanced'
	

Wed Sep  9 16:06:44 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* dev/extract-docs (ProcessVarComment): Set module for
	$vars{$description} hash -- fixes undef-d variable bug

Tue Sep  8 17:14:20 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* dev/extract-docs:  Added -O option for
	scwm-variables.txt

Mon Sep  7 11:15:05 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* dev/extract-docs: Added some debug code, and fix bug
	that resulted in the last proc of a .scm file being missed.

Sun Sep  6 16:17:42 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* dev/extract-docs: Added -V option to write a
	user-options variable definition out to a file

Sun Sep  6 15:53:02 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* dev/extract-docs: Fix ReadRestOfComment for Scheme
	comments by stripping leading ;;;s.  fDebug-guard some debugging
	output.  force single words after /** so that long comments
	with /** prefixes don't get mistaken for /** special comments

Sun Sep  6 15:19:26 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* dev/extract-docs: Track
	$last_public_scheme_definition, and handle SCWM_VAR,
	SCWM_VAR_READ_ONLY, and ;;;**VAR markers.  Fix some bugs in
	ReadRestOfComment, and generalize to read scheme comments through
	lines matching ^;;;  Permit pct_ to convert to % in
	CNameMatchesSchemeName;  fix some bugs in redo-ing when eof hit in
	conditional of main loop

Sun Sep  6 13:14:22 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* dev/extract-docs: Look for SCWM_HOOK macros, and
	process the following comment as the docs for the hook, or warn
	about a missing comment.  Also check for mismatches between the C
	and Scheme names of the hook (and abstract out that facility for
	use in checking primitive's names -- see CNameMatchesSchemeName).
	Print a warning when encountering old-style /**HOOK documentation.

Sat Sep  5 15:05:21 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* dev/extract-docs: Test for eof in all the places I
	loop on <> so that the line numbers get reset properly (they
	were incorrect for the scheme files)

Fri Aug 21 18:05:10 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* dev/extract-docs: Track the current_module, and output
	that information to both scwm-procedures.txt and scwm.sgml

Fri Aug 21 15:43:37 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* dev/extract-docs: Use Damian Conway's Text::Balanced
	package (available from CPAN) to scan scheme procs more reliably.
	Later that functionality will be folded into the script.  Clean up
	warnings to have a space after "****".  Add -d option to specify
	root of source code.

Fri Aug 14 20:42:21 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* dev/extract-docs: Added -C option to only output
	  concepts chapters (quicker testing of DocBook tables format)

Fri Aug 14 19:29:11 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* dev/extract-docs: First go at extracting comments from
	  the scheme source files.  Pretty broken right now, but am going
	  to update to try to use the Text::Balanced module by Damian
	  Conway to match parens instead of using regexp hacks.

Wed Aug 12 09:36:21 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* dev/extract.scm:  Added, and updated with newest
	  version.  Written by Harvey J. Stein.

1998-07-24  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* extract-docs: Lowercase the known words.  Abstract out the
	marking and the ispell-running into subroutines. Fix a bug in
	IspellText -- it was not splitting on digits, but ispell does.

	* dev/extract-docs: Added hooks and concepts chapters.
	The markup within the source needs to be revised to use DocBook
	tables, etc., but otherwise this is close to working

1998-07-23  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* dev/extract-docs: Added id's to refentry's, and add
	links to reference them.  Also add ulinks to source
	files. Reworked chapter two output to be just the primitive names
	and links to the chapter 1 descriptions.

1998-07-22  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* dev/extract-docs: Added spell checking using 'ispell
	-a' as an option (-s);  use $filename and $line instead of $ARGV
	and $. for readability

	* dev/extract-docs: Added -o option for specifying
	output .sgml file, don't markup & in scwm-procedures.txt -- use
	$markup_usage to hold a copy, and mark that up, instead.

	* dev/extract-docs: Add usage comment, options, clean up
	leading/trailing whitespace, separate procs on stdout by ^L

1998-07-21  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* dev/extract-docs: Add sections for the per-file
	sorting of function names.  Remove extra spaces in refpurpose,
	improve some debug support.  Fixed bug whereby parameter names
	which were subsequences of each caused problems.

	* dev/extract-docs: Add second chapter w/ prims sorted
	by function name, and deal with `procedure' convention.  Should
	really be linked much better than it is, but I don't know the
	docbook DTD at all.

	* dev/extract-docs: Actually generate .sgml file using
	docbook format.  Also, treat the first line of the comment
	docstring specially like Emacs docstrings (I should've made this
	explicit before -- the docstrings need editing to make the first
	line a better "purpose" statement -- extract-docs gives warnings
	to help find such strings)

	* dev/extract-docs: Check the expected primitive name,
	and warn if it doesn't match the c function name.  Handle _to_
	turning into -> optionally.  Also handle mis-parses better

	* dev/extract-docs: (see also change logs in scwm/scwm
	directory) Ensure formals are mentioned in doc string

Mon Jun  1 20:25:47 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* dev/Makefile.in, scwmexec/Makefile.in, Makefile.in:
 	regenerated with automake 1.3 (others too, see individual
 	ChangeLogs)

Tue Mar 31 21:09:32 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmrepl/scwmrepl.c, scwmexec/scwmexec.c:
 	Changed main's return type to int, and return 0, not exit(0);
 	Thanks Ken Pizzini <ken@halcyon.com>

Tue Mar 24 17:18:25 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* emacs/scwm.el: Fixed keybindings for XEmacs, and added
	missing (require 'scheme)

1998-03-19 Thu 16:08:43 EST Sam Steingold <sds@usa.net>

	* emacs/scwm.el: fixed completion, documentation and
	scwm-run.  The latter re-runs scwmrepl in the same buffer now.

Thu Mar 12 20:28:57 1998  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* */Makefile.in: Move -lscwmexec to directly after
 	-L../libscwmexec, instead of after the X libraries -- was causing
 	problems with `cc' on Irix 6.2 for Jesse Glick.

Thu Mar 12 09:20:49 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* emacs/scwm.el: Added scwm-procedure-documentation, and
 	some support functions; Fixed scwm-complete to go back an sexp,
 	not just a word

Wed Mar 11 22:56:28 1998  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* emacs/scwm.el: Added rudimentary completion support --
	mostly proof of concept that an elisp guru should look at.

Wed Mar 11 21:57:57 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Don't attempt to build scwmsend.

	* scwmsend, utilties/emacs/scwm-buffer.el: removed so
 	scwmsend stuff can be removed from scwm.

Tue Mar 10 22:57:51 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* scwmexec/scwmexec.c: Capitalized EXPRESSION in the
 	usage note. Thanks to Sam Steingold <sds@usa.net> for the bug
 	report.

Mon Mar  9 09:12:21 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* scwmexec/scwmexec.c: Use scwmexec_exec_full and
 	display output and errors, if any, resulting from the evaluation.


Sat Feb 28 19:24:18 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* dev/fvwm2-module-adapter: Pretty much works now - runs
 	the fvwm2 pager flawlessly if you load it into a running scwm,
 	other modules may or may not work (for testing change the module
 	name at the end). However, this functionality really needs to be
 	packaged better, and some stuff on the C side needs cleaning up.

Fri Feb 27 21:16:29 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* scwmrepl/scwmrepl.c, scwmrepl/Makefile.in:
	A new program using libscwmexec; it gives you a repl session
	with a running scwm.

	* libscwmexec/libmain.c,
 	utlities/libscwmexec/scwmsend.h, utlities/libscwmexec/Makefile.in,
 	scwmexec/scwmexec.c, scwmexec/Makefile.in:
	library and example program for the new scwmexec protocol.
	
Thu Feb 26 21:46:06 1998  Greg J. Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* emacs/scwm-buffer.el: Updated to use the $DISPLAY
 	environment variable to choose which X server to open a connection
 	to define-key for scwm-interaction-mode-map, not scheme-mode-map

Fri Dec 12 16:12:17 1997  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmsend/Makefile.in: Added creation
 	of installation directories -- thanks to Simon Josefsson
 	<jas@pdc.kth.se>

1997-10-24  Jens-Ulrik Holger Petersen  <petersen@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp>

	* Makefile.in (mostlyclean): New target.
