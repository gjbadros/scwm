# Menu generator script for the SCWM Window Manager
# written by Francesco Tapparo
# This gets installed into /etc/X11/scwm/scwm_menus on Debian GNU/Linux systems

# The version of the menu package that can process this.
compat="menu-1"

# for local preferences, so that system managers can override title(),
# icon(), and maybe later more. Note that to use that in this file,
# one has to use title(), and _not_ $title etc.
