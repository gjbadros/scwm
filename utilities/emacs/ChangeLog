	than 1 line, display `scwm-eval-buffer'.
	(scwm-eval-rectangle): new function: eval rectangle.

	line starts in the string.

	the current file.

Wed Mar 10 20:02:41 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.el: Rewrite "SCWM" as "Scwm" throughout (less bothersome to
 	the eye).  Update the initial comments to reflect some more tips.
  	Always autoload id-select-symbol, as it was causing problems for
 	XEmacs.  This results in a compile-time warning for Emacs, but at
 	least it doesn't result in a run-time error for XEmacs.
