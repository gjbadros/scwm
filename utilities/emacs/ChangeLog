	* scwm.el: Only mess with font-lock stuff (if featurep
	'font-lock).  Thanks Robert Bihlmeyer for bug report!

Fri Apr  2 10:46:34 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.el: Added `scwm-use-session' to do the use-modules of
	(ice-9 session). This is now called in scwm-make-obarray (instead
	of doing the use inline) and *also* in scwm-apropos.  Fixes bug
	whereby doing apropos before a completion (after a
	restart/startup) would result in a message about apropos not being 
	defined by this version of guile.

Sun Mar 28 15:02:45 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.el: Also display the *wm* buffer if the output/returned
 	value is only one line but is wider than the frame-width.  Reset
 	scwm-obarray inside scwm-load-file.  Lookup option documentation,
 	too (using `scwm-option-documentation'), not just
 	procedure-documentation. Set the size of the *wm* window
	appropriately.

Thu Mar 25 18:22:03 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.el: Change buffer nume to *wm* so that *sc<TAB> still
	expands to *scratch*.  (Silly, I know, but useful.)

Wed Mar 24 19:08:35 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.el: Comment-out the keydef of C-c C-l to scheme-load-file; 
	it was scwm-load-file, and I've come to use that binding a lot.

1999-03-24  Sam Steingold  <sds@goems.com>

	* scwm.el (font-keywds): added fontification for #&optional &c.

1999-03-23  Sam Steingold  <sds@goems.com>

	* scwm.el (scwm-eval-buffer): new variable.
	(scwm-eval-sexp): use it; when the output to minibuffer is longer
	than 1 line, display `scwm-eval-buffer'.
	(scwm-eval-rectangle): new function: eval rectangle.
	(scwm-uncomment-string): new function: remove comments from
	line starts in the string.
	(scwm-eval-uncommenting): uncomment the region (buffer is NOT
	modified!) and eval it.

1999-03-18  Sam Steingold  <sds@goems.com>

	* scwm.el: added scheme-mode compatibility bindings.
	removed a compile warning.

Fri Mar 12 14:43:35 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.el: Added note about using C-u C-c C-l <RETURN> to reload
	the current file.

Wed Mar 10 20:02:41 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwm.el: Rewrite "SCWM" as "Scwm" throughout (less bothersome to
 	the eye).  Update the initial comments to reflect some more tips.
  	Always autoload id-select-symbol, as it was causing problems for
 	XEmacs.  This results in a compile-time warning for Emacs, but at
 	least it doesn't result in a run-time error for XEmacs.

1999-02-09  Sam Steingold  <sds@goems.com>

	* scwm.el (scwm-load-file): new function, bound to C-c C-l

Tue Jan  5 07:43:21 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* auto-insert-tkld.el: Added for use with
 	utilities/dev/new-{scheme-primitive,type-skeleton}.cc

1998-12-12  Sam Steingold  <sds@goems.com>

	* scwm.el (scwm-apropos): should be working again.

1998-12-12  Sam Steingold  <sds@goems.com>

	* scwm.el: fixed capitalization.

1998-12-03  Sam Steingold  <sds@goems.com>

	* scwm.el (scwm-apropos): fix for the case when there is no
	`apropos' in guile.

Mon Nov 16 17:44:33 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Make sure scwm.el is noticed by `make dist'.

Tue Jun  2 17:21:19 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* scwm.el: Apply documentation fixes courtesy of Robert Bihlmeyer
 	<robbe@orcus.priv.at>. Also correct spelling of Sam's name.
