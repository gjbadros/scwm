	* scwm.el: Rewrite "SCWM" as "Scwm" throughout (less bothersome to
 	the eye).  Update the initial comments to reflect some more tips.
  	Always autoload id-select-symbol, as it was causing problems for
 	XEmacs.  This results in a compile-time warning for Emacs, but at
 	least it doesn't result in a run-time error for XEmacs.
