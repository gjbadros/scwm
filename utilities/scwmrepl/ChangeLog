	* scwmrepl.c: Use scwmconfig.h, not config.h.

1999-08-30  Robert Bihlmeyer  <robbe@orcus.priv.at>

	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Explicitly mention include dir so that
	srcdir != builddir works.

Sat Jul 31 19:32:44 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmrepl.c (main): Use ARG_UNUSED, and #include arg_unused.h

Tue Jul  6 08:32:01 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmrepl.c: Added inclusion of config.h

Tue Jun 29 16:01:33 1999  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Use @GUILE_INCLUDES@ for INCLUDES, as well as
	@x_cflags@  (Thanks Stephen Tell!)

Tue Mar 16 08:36:25 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmrepl.c: Do not use "unsigned char" -- hide that X anomaly in
 	libscwmexec instead.  Use apropos-internal, not apropos, so parse
 	the result value instead of the output.  Also, just parse using
 	strtok, since it's a much simpler format.  Clean up after free-d
 	variables consistently, just in case.  Do not assume a char is 1
 	byte.  I have tested this, and it works great for me now.

Mon Mar 15 18:01:08 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmrepl.c: Use `apropos-internal', not `apropos' to do
	completion, and scwmexec_exec "(use-modules (ice-9 sessioon))" at
	startup to be sure that support exists for apropos.  (Changes are
	untested, but inspired directly from scwm.el -- I was noticing
	differences in behaviour between scwmrepl and scwm.el that were
	unfortunate that I expect this fixes but have only 1 X server
	available at present).

Sun Aug 30 17:13:10 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmrepl.c: Replace stdio with stdout-- was totally broken--
	thanks Perry Metzger!

Fri Aug 14 09:35:32 1998  Greg Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* scwmrepl.c:
	  Don't send the error or result as the second arg to fprintf
	  since then special character interpretation is done -- use %s,
	  and send the result as the third argument.

1998-06-18  Maciej Stachowiak  <maciej@roc-ny5-14.ix.netcom.com>

 	for the bug report and patch.

Mon Mar  9 09:13:12 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* scwmrepl.c: Report errors and output, if any; also, stop
 	printing "; Value: " before printing the value.

Sun Mar  8 23:56:55 1998  Maciej Stachowiak  <mstachow@mit.edu>

	* scwmrepl.c: Coreected check_balance to correctly detect
 	expression boundaries.
