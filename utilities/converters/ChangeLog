	* Wrote fvwm2rc-to-scwmrc and converted first version. Since it
 	rained yesterday here in often-sunny Melbourne, I ended up 
	coding a fvwm2rc translator in Perl, based on the design I've
	rambled on a bit about here.  I've just committed my first go at
	it, which is only kinda-sorta tested against RedHat 5.x's
	system.fvwm2rc.  It seems to pretty much do the right thing, and
	handles *all* of system.fvwm2rc, converting to a pretty usable
	.scwmrc.  Numerous commands conversions aren't yet implemented,
	but the framework is all there and it shouldn't  be that hard to
	finish off (I just don't have time right now).
 
        Note that the converter puts fvwm2 functions where they are first
	encountered (unless you give it the '-1' option to restrict it to
	a single pass and reduce memory consumption).  Also note that
	menus with pixmaps, sub menus, modules, functions, bindings, and
	more are all attempted to be preserved.
