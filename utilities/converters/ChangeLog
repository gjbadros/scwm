	* fvwm2rc-to-scwmrc: Handle implied modules earlier than before,
 	to catch uses of e.g. "FvwmForm LogoutVerify".  Use new sub
 	HandleRunModule since that's now done in two places.  Drop
 	convert_action entirely -- use convert_fvwm_command for static and
 	dynamic commands.  Use with-window in the function templates.
  	Added sub get_optional_two_num_args_and_win and make it understand
 	move, animatedmove function arguments.  Drop the p from move args
 	like "0p".  Drop the "N" binding modifier (it was a placeholder
 	for "None" in fvwm2).  Output looks pretty good after re-indenting
 	in Emacs.  Parentheses are balanced.  Only a few things are
 	ignored completely.  Have not tested by trying to load into Scwm.
  	The "FrontAnd" fvwm function is the biggest complication I see
 	going forward.  Some fvwm2 functions (like FrontAnd) should be
 	expanded inline and then converted via convert_fvwm_command.

	* fvwm2rc-to-scwmrc: Handle arguments to functions. Use a
 	fvwm2-mods-and-keysym-convert proc in the preface to do run-time
 	combination of arguments to bind-key, if needed.  Added
 	dquoted_if_string to only quote arguments that aren't numbers--
 	args are passed in their natural form to the functions generated.
  	Also replace -$2 with (- $2).  Handles the KeyMouseMoves stuff
 	now, and not too much was done as a special case (though I also
 	didn't try to generalize that much either).  Added
 	get_two_nums_or_args for cursormove function -- using scanning
 	subroutines (instead of regexps) should happen a lot more than it
 	does now.  (Stripped out the argument-post-processing from Doug as 
	I don't think that's the right thing).

	* fvwm2rc-to-scwmrc: Infer module names by the "Module foo"
	constructs that get converted to run-fvwm2-modules.  Use those
	inferred names to handle lots more module lines correctly.

Fri Apr  2 11:52:02 1999  Greg J Badros  <gjb@cs.washington.edu>

	* fvwm2rc-to-scwmrc (script_usage): Added $menu_id_char_seq,
	$num_or_arg_seq, $word_or_arg_seq.  (The regexps should ultimately 
	be replaced by function argument parsing subroutines, but I am
	more interested in dealing with other parts right now).  Added
	converters for "echo", "setenv", "hilightcolor", "xorvalue",
	"colormapfocus", "clicktime".  Permit arguments to move, resize,
	cursormove, key.  Add unknown modules to module "UNKNOWN" instead
	of dropping those lines.  Change some warnings/error messages.

	* fvwm2rc-to-scwmrc: Lots of changes from Doug McNaught -- see the 
	file log.

	* Wrote fvwm2rc-to-scwmrc and converted first version. Since it
 	rained yesterday here in often-sunny Melbourne, I ended up 
	coding a fvwm2rc translator in Perl, based on the design I've
	rambled on a bit about here.  I've just committed my first go at
	it, which is only kinda-sorta tested against RedHat 5.x's
	system.fvwm2rc.  It seems to pretty much do the right thing, and
	handles *all* of system.fvwm2rc, converting to a pretty usable
	.scwmrc.  Numerous commands conversions aren't yet implemented,
	but the framework is all there and it shouldn't  be that hard to
	finish off (I just don't have time right now).
 
        Note that the converter puts fvwm2 functions where they are first
	encountered (unless you give it the '-1' option to restrict it to
	a single pass and reduce memory consumption).  Also note that
	menus with pixmaps, sub menus, modules, functions, bindings, and
	more are all attempted to be preserved.
